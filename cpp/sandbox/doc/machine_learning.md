## Plan
-[x] Define Machine Learning / AI
  * AI -> Machine Learning -> Deep Learning
    * Deep Learning is basically ML using multilayered neural networks. The
      network models self-learn to improve the models ability to conduct a
      task.
  * Using computers to mimic human learning to complete tasks
  * The tasks usually fall in one of a few categories:
    1. Prediction
    2. Classifcation / Categorization / Grouping / Clustering

-[ ] Figure out what machine learning algorithms are applicable for predicting
future price
  * Neural Networks seem most applicable. So far the most applicable-seeming
    models are:
    * Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

-[ ] Seek or custom build implementations of said algorithm(s)
