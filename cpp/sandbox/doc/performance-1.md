* Win / Loss: 2W (Consecutive: 2) 0L (Consecutive: 0)

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I started with incorrect math that prevented the account balance form closing
  closer to the peak. Luckily the math worked out well enough that it could
  close when the profit resurged to the minimum threshold, hence the win.
* I corrected the math, restarted in Beta, and the target profit easing was
  working at the account level.
* Since I started Beta during a consolidation period that never broke, it lost
  money, but not before peaking at a respectable profit.
* I may adjust the target profit easing rates and further reduce the number of
  trading assets, but I think I may be at another working iteration that I'll
  monitor next week.

* Holding win positions for a long time is still working well.
* I'm introducing a new concept: Sigmoid-Eased Peak Profit Expansion
* The way it works is as follows:
  * Set target profit
  * When that target is reached, extend it
  * The new target profit will sigmoidally diminish over a calibrated time to a
    specified minimum.
* This approach allows profits to reach their natural maxima and gives them
  sufficient time to extend them. The diminish period is 1 hour for each asset
  position, two hours for the account's daily profit.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I can't properly count today's results as wins because the peaks resulted
  from luckily timed restarts.
* What was apparent, however, were a few things:
  * Long holding profits is a good idea that helps avoid unnecessary double
    losses.
  * The timed diminishing profit target was also an excellent idea. I modified
    it to use the order's `max_profit_timestamp` instead of the order's start
    timestamp. This way it can reset as the profit hits new peaks.
  * I'm also reducing the target max profit hold time from two hours to one.
  * It's still a toss up whether a win should trigger a reversal. A reversal
    seemed more correct today. I'll try again for tomorrow.
  * I think a 40x 1-sec loss threshold prevents jumpiness during periods of
    lower volatility, but I think a smaller exit threshold will be better for
    high volatility periods. The morning lost heavily because of large loss
    thresholds that triggered.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try
* Small loss threshold during high volatility, high loss threshold during low
  volatility.

* Rough day again. No considerable profit was realized despite a day of strong
  trending.
* The trailing stop is still working as intended.
* Loss positions are still being held too long and much of the max profit is
  lost to a deep trailing stop.
* At the end of the day I reduced the exit threshold to the smallest it's ever
  been: 10x 1-sec variance.
* It peaked at a profit of ~ +1.1% and seemed to be riding short-term trends as
  intended.
* We'll start tomorrow with this iteration and see how it goes.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I had to break Round 1. In the morning it dropped to -5.58% loss. After the
  bear trend broke it shot up back to +0.38% profit. This was encouraging,
  suggesting that even if it lost heavily, it could also gain heavily. However,
  after several more hours of running, consolidation periods had drained the
  profit back down to -3.09% loss. This shouldn't have been the case given how
  strongly the price was trending for all assets. It suggested that the exit
  threshold was still too shallow.
* Reset the account's balance to $30K and increased the exit threshold to 40x
  1-sec variance.
* This profited, however the prices were still trending significantly, so it's
  hard to tell how effective it truly was. We'll see on Monday how it goes.
* Have a good weekend! You'll figure this out!

* This didn't perform well and I reverted to the opening strategy with the same
  increased exit threshold.
* Try not to break and hold even if the morning is off to a bad start.

    frivolously.
* There were also very good win streaks:
  * AAPL: 1
  * AMZN: 5

  * MSFT: 4

* I was watching the exit points and I really think that a 20x 1-sec variance
  is the Goldie Locks exit threshold. I'd _strongly_ suggest that I don't
  change it as I'm observing over the next several days.
* This iteration is pretty close to what I've been trying to build.
* Starting tomorrow, I'll measure it's daily performance and see if I can set a
  realistic daily target profit.

```

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I started the day with trying to ride short trends but the stop loss was too
  tight and triggered too much loss.
* I loosened them and set the target win to 35x 1-sec variance with a 15x 1-sec
  variance trailing stop. This actually worked pretty well and got to a +2.09%
  return.
* This iteration ended at a slight loss after a hectic conslidation period, but
  I still felt it left too much profit on the table.
* I'm now solely using the trailing stop to make profit. That is, the profit
  starts once the trailing stop is exceeded.
* The trailing stop is 15x 1-sec variance.
* This should still successfully ride trends to their reasonable end, but it
  will also take smaller profits sooner.
* It still remains to be seen whether placing an opposite trade post-win is
  better than placing a same-direction trade.
* I still feel confident I can figure something out that attains a >1-2% daily
  profit, even on consolidation days.

```

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Today started with modest trending, hence the early peak.
* I'm going to try some new things.
* I think a good takeaway from the last few weeks is that you should be patient
  in stopping wins. The ideal is that I can follow wins to their true
  reversal points.
* What's been hard in the past few weeks is figuring out the proper stop win
  threshold. Is it 40x, 80x, or 150x the 1-sec variance? What about legitimate
  smaller scale trends that occur while waiting for that target point?
* I'm going to re-visit maximizing profits by:
  1. Riding a trend to its true end.
  2. Waiting for it to reverse by an amount equal to the loss amount.
  3. Opening a position in the opposite direction.
* This will be challenging for periods when the price is trending in one
  direction with intermittent sharp corrections. However, the loss threshold
  expansion during heightened volatility should help counteract this.
* I'm not sure how successful this will be, but it will be interesting to see.

* What seems interesting to work on a large scale is a high win-to-loss exit
  threshold ratio.
* Perhaps we can reduce the scale from 150:50 to 80:20 or something like that.
* Most securities have a hard time reaching 120 or 150x 1-sec variance in

##### Stocks/ETFs
* 0/6 won again today üò≥.
* Something interesting is happening.
* This is the first time in weeks (maybe in a month) where there have been two
  consecutive big loss days.
* It's max loss almost reached -6% which has been unheard of for the last
  several weeks.
* I think what's happening is this:
  * Right now most assets are hitting a resistance point to the bull run of the
    last couple of weeks.
  * This consolidation period is kryptonite to a momentum strategy.
* This doesn't mean that this consolidation period will last indefinitely.
  However, it does demonstrate that it can and will occur for multiple days.
* It's scary. My knee jerk instinct is to shut everything down and observe
  staging for more time, but I can't ignore the success of the last two weeks.
  Remember, in all take balance profit scenarios, TaoBot made money.
* However, I think it will be more wise to weather the storm, even if it means
  putting more money in, once the $25K threshold is breached.
* This may demonstrate the need for spreading the risk between equities and
  currencies.
* OR maybe the tough fact that this strategy will ultimately break even or lose
  money, no matter how long of a period of profitability it demonstrates.

* After computing the total % return in each of the target profit strategies,
  targetting 3.5% has the greatest return in 10 days 0of observation.
* What's more reassuring is that ALL strategies had a positve return over the
  last 10 days. I think this goes beyond fluke and is evidence that this could
  be very profitable over the long run. ü§ë

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Uhhh WEIRD day üò≥
* The day OPENED with a few things in the Alpha account:
  1. A +6% gain üéâ
  2. A severely slashed margin buying power üòµ
  3. A margin buying power multiplier that remained `4`.
  4. A large AMD position that had been open all of yestderday and into today
     because of order cancellation segfaults I was debugging on Friday.
* This created a bizarre, but interesting scenario:
  * Normally the buying power is the lesser of `margin buying power` and
    `(balance * margin multiplier (4)) / number of assets traded`.
  * At the beginning of the day, `margin buying power` and `balance * margin
    multiplier` are roughly equivalent, so if the balance-multipler product is
    used, there will be enough buying power for all trades. Let's call this
    product the Presumed Buying Power.
  * This morning, however, the divvied Presumed Buying Power (~$18K per asset)
    was still less than the actual avaialable buying power (~$68K), but not
    enough to open trades for each asset with the presumed amount (i.e. $18K *
    6 >> $27K * 4)
  * As a result, most assets opened below their anticipated quantities and TSLA
    couldn't ever open a position.
* I'm fairly sure that this was all because the AMD position was open overnight
  and all will return to normal tomorrow.
* It does make me wonder, however, if I should adjust the quantity algorithm to
  deal with only the available margin buying power.
* After an hour, I finally resolved to run the app on `Beta` to see if it could
  still profit. While it didn't hit the big targets, it still kept the loss
  small, less than the target 2-4% range.

* Though the day was marked by strong extended trends, there was good variety

* If I had closed at 4%, I would have missed out on ~2% gain.
  * This is interesting. It's still unclear whether I should always let TaoBot
    run all day because of this outcome, or if I should always close at 4+%
    since some days close below 4%.
  * Maybe I'll run 4+% Close on production and All Day Run on staging.
* It's good that I didn't change the algorithm after yestderday's loss.
* Yesterday's loss supported what I already knew: since this is a
  momentum-based algorithm, it will fail on days that spend most if not all day
  consolidating. The prevalence of these days remains in question.
* Longest loss streaks before final position:
  * AAPL (4)
  * AMZN (3)
  * MSFT (3)

##### Stocks/ETFs
* Very interesting day. 1/6 won.
* Every asset started the day with thrashing consolidation and didn't
  significantly trend throughout the rest of the day.
* This can and does happen. I'm not sure that there's anything that a
  momentum-based approach can do against this.
* What is encouraging, however, is that the current iteration still keeps loss
  between -3-4%.
* Change nothing and continue to observe. Remember, before today, the last four
  consecutive days peaked at >4%.
* The trend that I'm seeing since the 07/29 iteration is that gains/losses will
  be somewhere between +/- 2-4%, and will peak slightly beyond that in most
  cases.
* Continue to observe if this is true, until next Wednesday. If it is, turn on
  the take profit at the 4.25 (0.2 trailing stop level).
* It will still be wise of you to wait for a $30K account balance before going
  live.

* The reduced take profit threshold was enough to secure profits. It couldn't
  secure a bear trend profit, but it was still good.
* This is the fourth consecutive day with a max greater than 4%. I still have
  yet to see whether I should use it as a target profit, or if  I should keep
  trying to end the day at the max profit.

  really good!
* This peak and the positive return were DEFINITELY a result of securing a
  profit after 200x 1-sec variance.
* This allowed almost all assets to profit on the bull and bear trends.
* I try reducing the take profit to 150x 1-sec variance because 200x seemed
  like a bit much.
* MSFT never won and lost 9 times. Yesterday TSLA similarly lost 7 times. I'm
  not sure if increasing the loss threshold will decrease the loss likelihood.
* It's worth a shot but I'll keep it at 30x and first observe how the 150x
  secure profit works.

* However, everyone's trends started to reverse and TSLA ran into a 7-streak
  loss at the inflection point.
* It's still a win because the max balance was exceptional, but I'm going to
  see if securing a very large win in hopes of following a reversal trend will
  help lead to open-ended gains.
* If it still doesn't by the end of the week, I may look at the average max
  balance and re-implement a stop profit loss strategy.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try
* I had an interesting idea: What if instead of taking profits, you left them
  open ended?
* When you take a profit one of a few things will happen:
  1. The price will soon reverse and continue in the opposite direction, thus
     nullifying the gain.
  2. The price will keep going in the profit direction. In this case you would
     have been better off staying in the position since closing and opening
     necessitates a brief pause in gains.
  3. The price reverses, triggers a loss, then reverses again to continue in
     the original direction.
* In cases 2 & 3, you would have been better off staying in the orignal
  position, so maybe TaoBot only closes enough times for the day's trend to
  establish itself.
* If not the day's trend, then a long enough trend to reach the account's
  target profit.
* I'll have to leave TaoBot on all day for the next several days to record the
  results, but it's possible that this will result in similar if not greater
  returns.

#### (STAGING) Stats (as of 2022-06-27)
* Win / Loss: 11W (Consecutive: 0) 7L (Consecutive: 2)
* Times loss dipped below 2% then loss: 3

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* A second consecutive loss day for the first Alpha round üò≠
* This is what seems apparent:
  * No matter how small the target profit (including 0) it's always possible to
    not attain it if the prices are consolidating.
  * You should leave TaoBot on all day:
    * Large trend days will profit
    * If you select the proper exit boundaries, consolidation days should only lose mildly.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Day didn't start with clear performance because of a coding bug.
* I reset Staging's balance and restarted with 1.25 hours left.
* 2 of the last 3 days lost 3%. That can't happen if this strategy is to make
  money over time.
* Maybe I need to increase the exit threshold to reduce the severity of loss
  days.
* Yesterday demonstrated why it could be much better to leave TaoBot on all day
  if the day happens to be a long trend day.
* The problem with this is how many days trend like this?
* I've mostly seen losses after prolonged running. Is it possible that there's
  an exit threshold that keeps losses to a minimum on consolidation days?

#### Remarks

* The current plan is to target a 1.05% return with .1% trailing stop that
  expands to a 0.5, or maybe 1% trailing stop.
* This could perhaps help take advantage of large win days.
* The stop loss will be 3%.

* I may have to accept that a moment-based strategy can and will lose. I just
  need to lose a stop loss that matches the stop profit.
* I'll need more data to determine what the appropriate thresholds are. Right
  now I'm going to try +/-4.0%

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* 4/6 won
* The target max profit was reached, but it didn't close the stop profit was
  breached. This is because not all TaoBot instances recorded the exceeded max
  profit in time.
* I'm going to need to create a separate process that "streams" the account
  balance by polling it over a short interval.
* I'll presist this to a JSON file and each TaoBot instance will read from it
  and fetch as a fallback.
* This way, hopefully all instances exit when they should.

  * QQQ:  +$398.76   ü•â
  * SPY:  +$270.83
  * TSLA: +$1,132.91 ü•á
* I'm toying with the idea of only trading the highest cash flow assets.
  However, if I had done that today with AMZN and TSLA on the beta account, I
  would have been down.
* It's probably best to continue spreading the risk across multiple assets.

* After the main account closed and restarted on the beta account, here was its
  return:
  * Today's Max Gain:  $29,360.52 (+386.44)  (+1.33%)
  * Today's Max Loss:  $25,470.13 (-$685.07) (-2.36%)
  * Return (STAGING):  +$55.31 (+0.19% Account)

* The assets spent much time consolidating and some time trending so this
  tracks.

#### Friday Report
* All in all, today was a good week. 3/4 days won, two of them met / exceeded
  the trailing stop daily threshold.
* It still remains to be seen whether cycling through the exit thresholds helps
  eliminate or reduce the gravity of loss days.
* This is a good intro into the weekend and MiniConf week.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* The morning started with the exact movement that would lead to major loss:
  consolidation at the exact height of the exit prices.
* When the -5% emergency brake fired, I restarted with an adjustment:
  * Cycle through a series of 1-sec variance multipliers: 20x, 30x, 40x.
* After a couple of hours it was actually profitting. Then at 1pm, volatility
  spiked and started incurring loss.
* However, by the end of the day it was about +0.5% from the restart.
* We'll see if this is an adequate defense against sharp fluctuations or I just
  got lucky with trending.

  * SPY:  +$118.88
  * TSLA: +$409.60 ü•á
* The target profit was reached and the trailing stop was breached but didn't
  exit for two reasons:
  1. Not all instances of TaoBot recorded the attained target proft before the
     profit had slipped.
  2. `should_close_position` wasn't closing if the `should_stop_profit` is true
* I've made the appropriate changes and will run on the Hedge account for the
  rest of the day to compare results and see if I can figure out a way to
  profit during consolidation.
* As expected, Hedge Account lost -2.32% after picking up where the Main
  Account exited.

* I was almost sure that the day would trigger the emergency brake since it
  didn't profit in the morning.
* It almost did, but actually ended up near the day's high at day's end.
* This dashes some confidence, but I still think it's worth trying it for
  several days and observing results.

  the greatest earning (and loss) potential.

* Again, exit price expansion during high volatility worked well, so keep that.
* 40x 1-sec variance is still working well as each sample size increases, so
  I'll probably stay here. However, MSFT still hit a 5-loss losing streak,
  bolstering the long loss inevitability theory.
* The samples increases by ~30-40K (AAPL ended at 137,516 samples)

* 4/6 could have cashed out at 2% return, but they had to wait til 3pm.
* AAPL, one of the two who couldn't, almost just reached the 2% target.
* High volatility expansion of the exit thresholds worked well.
* I'm now waiting for each price movement average to reach 500K samples. Each
  symbol averages about 40-50K per day.
* As movement slowed, the thresholds shrank. This shrinkage should diminish as
  the average's sample size increases.
* I'll probably need to increase the coefficient as the one-sec variance
  averages decrease.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-06-23:
#### Remarks
* Started the day with non-expanding exit prices (only 40x long-term one-sec
  variance) and got raped.
* Resolved: You MUST always expand the exit thresholds as volatility spikes. If
  not, you WILL lose lots of money.
* In fact, this is probably why the interest rate announcements wipe you out,
  and that's why stopping the algorithm when volatility exceeds an threshold
  amount makes sense.
* We'll see if the increased sample size of the long-term one-sec variance
  mixed with volatility expansion works better tomorrow.

### 2022-06-22:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Day started off with good trending that would have probably led to a win if I
  was staking the full amount. However, I was instead staking just one unit per
  trade.
* Consolidation later in the day led to the max loss.
* I'm going to increase the max sample size for the price movement to 100K to
  see if I can get a more static average and use a fixed multiple of that
  throughout the day.

### 2022-06-22:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Time based exits didn't work.
* Reverted to one-sec variance. This performed okay.
* Gonna see how this is again while preventing trade opening when volatility is
  >= 3.0
* How does it peform across days? Should I just do martingale across days?
* Maybe you can demonstrate that it profits over a long time and take to Oanda?

##### Stocks/ETFs
* Interesting day.
* The fed raised interest rates at 1pm which sent prices crazy.
* One-sec variance volatility hit absurd highs:
  * AMZN - Short-term ~1000% the long-term
  * TSLA - Short-term ~800% the long-term
  variance.
* In this instance and in prior similar outlier events, TaoBot has tended to
  perform very poorly.
* I'll compare this to the morning's volatility fluctuations and set a maximum
  volatility condition to opening a position.
* I still have high confidence in this algorithm's success potential. What the
  interest rate hike demonstrates is that it still struggles in periods of
  immense volatility.
* I'll either have to figure out how to handle these heightened volatility
  periods, or just keep out during them.

  ```

* Observation: I used to think that martingale would only work if you never
  reached the max expected loss, which you should set to an amount that could
  never realistically be reached. I think this is incorrect.

  By instead setting the max expected loss to the median loss streak (3 or 4) a
  few things will happen:
  * Long win streaks will be far more profitable
  * Most losses will be redeemed by wins
  * The loss streaks that exceed the max expected loss will just be in the same
    scenario as if the stakes were the same and maximized for each round.
    However, they will be less costly than equal stake rounds because you'll be
    building up to the max loss.
  * Since every round is seeking to reclaim the total deficit, the first
    redemptive win after the loss that exceeded the max expected loss, can be
    succceeded by wins to reclaim the total loss.

* I think the final max expected loss will be 3 or 4 and this should bring
  daily returns to a consistent 1-2%.

* The win rates were 43.59 (AMZN) and 41.38% (TSLA)
* The return was small because of low stake rounds.
* I'm going to decrease the expected loss to increase the base quantity.

  the day's return.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-06-10:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Interesting day. AMZN won after 6 rounds, MSFT after 7.
* However as predicted, most of the other assets slowly increased their losses
  throughout the rest of the day as the price started to consolidate.
* Near the day's end, I decided to try re-implementing martingale. I've noticed
  over the last couple of weeks that the average win rate has been 40 - 60%
  with few if any loss streaks exceeding 6. Maybe I have reached a point
  runaway martingale losses are unlikely.
* I tried this with AMZN and TSLA toward the day's end and AMZN recovered a
  well-sized deficit.
* I'll try again on Monday with just those two assets.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-06-09:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Today was a rare day where all assets won.
* I started by setting the exit threhsold to 30x the long-term one-second
  variance.
* This failed because the fast movement triggered many losses.
* I changed exit threshold to be the greater of the two one-sec variances.
* It was actually doing decently:
  * TSLA had reached its 1% return within a couple of hours.
  * The other assets, however, were mostly stuck in consolidation.
* However, shortly after 1pm CT, all assets prices started a sharp decline that
  lasted the rest of the day.
* This led to long win streaks across the board:
  * AAPL (13); AMZN (7); MSFT (5); QQQ (10); SPY (11)
* It's important to acknowledge that this is a rare circumstance. It is good to
  know, however, that in this scenario the algorithm makes the most money.
* What should happen more often is that if assets win, it will be within the
  first 1-2 hours.
* After that, they'll mostly lose during consolidation.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-06-08:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I tried going for 3% return.
* AMZN and TSLA almost made it, but didn't quite hit the mark.
* There were one or two that were also positive, but after the morning, most
  prices consolidated much of the rest of the day and resulted in losses.
* I'm going to go back to targeting 2% with an exit threshold of 30x the
  long-term 1-sec variance.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-06-07:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* AMZN: -750.99 after 02:47:14 of run time
* Switched to using long-term 3-minute one-sec variance. AMZN ended at -$63.36
  with a win rate of 48.48%
* 4/6 won today: AAPL, MSFT, QQQ, and SPY. That's very good
* 2/6 lost, AMZN lost ~$800. I think this is because the exit threshold shrank
  too much over time.
* In response, I'm going to use the long-term one-second variance taken over
  10K samples.
* This way, a profitable mid day can compensate for a losing morning
* I'm also increasing the target profit to 3% so the big winners can more
  greatly compensate for the losers.

  * What's the daily win rate across all assets?
  * Are there some that seem to consistently perform well? So far, TSLA is the
    top contender.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-06-02:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Interesting day
* The day started off very down, but then picked up by mid morning.
* By the near end of the day QQQ and TSLA were winning with win rates greater
  than 50%. AAPL and SPY's deficits overshadowed their siblings profits.
* The day started with consolidation at almost the exact height of the
  thresholdds.
* Since the prices movements slow throughout the day, it was hard for late day
  gains to overcome an early deficit.
* THEN at around 2:30pm CT, the stream just stopped receiving messages. It
  didn't error out, it was just non-responsive.
* This brought everyone's price movement to 0 and kicked off a flurry of
  immediate closures which tanked the day's gains.
* This made it apparent that I'll need to build a stream status check for
  `get_quote` to fall back to the historical quote endpoint if the streamed
  quote is stale.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-06-01:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Interesting day today.
* I started by observing the short tern one second net average and determing a
  threshold that might be a good entry indicator.
* Meanwhile TaoBot was following trends with an exit threshold of 20x one
  second variance. This ended at a loss after about 2 hours.
* Also, red4 was red-lining and I think this was intermittently interrupting
  the quote stream, so I moved everything to the desktop.
* When I implemented the one second net average threshold, it failed miserably.
* This led me to the following thought:
  * If I were to set the exit threshold at a ridiculously high amount, such
    that it would only execute one trade in the whole day, the stocks who
    happened to guess right would be the only ones to win. However, the right
    guessers would be guaranteed to win by the amount the price profited since
    the day's open.
  * If, however, I set the threshold too low, there will be many more trades,
    but there will be many losses because of temporary or sharp corrections.
  * The more trades there are, the more likely losses will dominate.
  * The goal should be to find the perfect threshold that will allows you to
    trade often enough to profit on put bear and bull trends, but not often
    enough that you're getting destroyed by fluctuations.
* I ended the day by trying 40x the one-second variance. This ended ~+$70 after
  about 2 hours of play.
* I'll observe this tomorrow on the desktop and increase the threshold if I
  think it's still too susceptible to corrections.

* Big bummer today üòû I accidentally started the app in production. Since it
  had succeeded in staging for the last five days, I figured it wouldn't be
  unreasonable to test it in production. Here were the results:

```

* The day started at a near 5% loss then rebounded to its peak, which was again
  at around 9:30am, then lost for much of the rest of the day.
* A few thing seem apparent:
  1. Maybe I do need to implement a premature close algorithm -- I haven't seen
     an single day in the last week that has ended at its peak.
    * I can at least do this and push to production until I can figure out a
      way to make money throughout the whole day.
  2. I probably need to spread the risk across multiple securities -- I suppose
     it's possible that there's some fundamental disadvantage in production
     that staging obscures. However, I think it's more likely that either the
     retarded near-win polling interval was excessively increased, or that a
     low win percentage is simply possible.
     * By spreading the risk across multiple securities, you'll reduce the
       chances of one blowout loss undoing a whole day's gains for its
       siblings.

* Today's performance makes me want to abandon trying to come up with a
  premature exit strategy.
* First, it appears that the slower polling near wins is in fact weighting wins
  since a win rate <50% still results in a profit.
* I'm still astounded by how close to 50% the win rate is over time when using
  pure random as an entry indicator.. I still don't quite understand why, but
  this is the fifth day in a row.
* A few things seem apparent:
  1. The more plays the greater the return.
    * This suggests that an asset with fast moving price will generate more
      return over the long run.
    * This is also a good sign for Forex which would run indefinitely.
    * Maybe it also means that the risk should be spread across many
      securities.
  2. It still closed at a fraction of the peak.
    * Still not sure if this means a reasonable premature exit needs to be
      engineered.
    * If it is, maybe it's:
      If you've played more than 100 rounds and your win rate is > 50.0%?
    * The peaks were at 9:30am (again), 10am, and 10:30am.
    * Not sure if this is a coincidence.
  3. Weighting the wins seems to be working -- There's a higher return for
     lower win rates. We'll see how it performs tomorrow.

* The day started off with a 25% win rate in the first half hour.
* By 9:30am it had mostly recovered its losses.
* It then spent most of the day with a < 50% win rate until 2:20pm when it hit
  its peak. Its win rate at this time was ~52%.
* It then hit a couple loss streaks and ended at 47.86%, BUT it still profited
  0.01%.
* Slowing down the polling interval for near wins and accelerating it for near
  losses seems to have favorable weighted wins to the point that a less than
  50% win rate still resulted in a modest profit.
* The day's win rate was to be expected if other days' win rates were >50%.
* A few questions to answer:
  * What about days when the win rate is closer to 40%?
  * Is it possible to time a cash out point?
  * What would be the effect of alternating direction on each trade to achieve
    a true 1:1 ratio of buys and sells?
  * Would it be better to pick a stock like TSLA with more price action?
* If this strategy will almost always result in near 50% win rate, maybe it
  makes sense to construct an early termination algorithm that says something
  like the following:
  * If the max win rate has exceeded 60%,
  * and the return has exceeded 2.0%,
  * and the current return has lost 20% of its peak value,
  * then you should stop trading for the day.
* For that to make sense, I would have to never see a trading day end at its
  peak return.
* I have seen this, but it is far more rare than early / mid-day peaks.

  Wins: 55 (51.40%) ‚Ä¢ Losses: 52 ‚Ä¢ Total: 107
  Loss Streak => Current: 0 ‚Ä¢ Longest: 5 ‚Ä¢ Counts: {1: 17, 2: 10, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1}
  Win  Streak => Current: 3 ‚Ä¢ Longest: 6 ‚Ä¢ Counts: {1: 18, 2: 5, 3: 7, 6: 1}

  Current Balance: +257.21 (+0.93%) ‚Ä¢ Max Balance: +775.07
  ```
* A pattern seems to be emerging -- the day's profits peak at ~10am CT. Today's
  profit peaked at 9:05am CT.
* If this pattern continues, consider terminating trading at that time until we
  can figure out a way to increase them throughout the day.
* Something to consider will also be how this will perform while running
  multiple instances of TaoBot.
* It's also great, but predicable, how close to a 50% win rate the coin flip
  brings about.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-05-16:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I implemented the Websocket stream and lags were successfully avoided.
* Here were the results:

  **STAGING**
  ```
  Wins: 70 (50.00%) ‚Ä¢ Losses: 70 ‚Ä¢ Total: 140
  Loss Streak => Current: 0 ‚Ä¢ Longest: 6 ‚Ä¢ Counts: {1: 15, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 3}
  Win  Streak => Current: 2 ‚Ä¢ Longest: 6 ‚Ä¢ Counts: {1: 15, 2: 8, 3: 5, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 1}

  Current Balance: +247.70 (+0.87%) ‚Ä¢ Max Balance: +1,346.55
  ```

* It's cool, but expected, that the win rate was exactly 50%. It's also cool
  that it still profited though it wouldn't have lasted too many more losses.

* Two wins in a row, which is great.
* I'm expecting that one or several days will have sub 50% win rates.
* To protect against this, I'd like the big wins to exceed the big losses.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try
* Shorten the round await interval during losses, and lengthen await time when
  winning.

### 2022-05-13:
#### Remarks
* I ran the first 45 minutes with the signal entry indicator, predicting a
  swing after the second loss. This was basically a wash.
* Then I reverted to a coin flip entry. This performed absurdly well:

  **STAGING**
  ```
  Wins: 66 (57.89%) ‚Ä¢ Losses: 48 ‚Ä¢ Total: 114
  Loss Streak => Current: 0 ‚Ä¢ Longest: 4 ‚Ä¢ Counts: {1: 15, 2: 4, 3: 7, 4: 1}
  Win  Streak => Current: 1 ‚Ä¢ Longest: 8 ‚Ä¢ Counts: {1: 11, 2: 9, 3: 2, 4: 3, 5: 1, 6: 1, 8: 1}

  Current Balance: +905.06 (~+3.3%) ‚Ä¢ Max Balance: +1,265.53
  ```

* This was with only 2x margin
* I think the reason why this worked much better than last time is that the
  stop profit and stop loss thresholds are roughly the same, and stop profit
  being flexible gives wins a bit more weight.
* I'll try this again on Monday with a WebSockets client streaming the quote
  prices. I'm still seeing positions exit or enter too late because of the
  laggy quote endpoint. Hopefully this will help improve performance.

### 2022-05-12:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Interesting, but confusing day.
* By ~10, TaoBot had earned $953.45. By the end of the day it was down
  -$2,160.01
* This was after experimenting with ways to counteract consolidation periods
  and taking profits that are 0.5 the loss.
* It's so odd that it can do so well at some times and so poorly during other
  times.
* I gotta figure out how to deal with consolidation.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try


### 2022-05-11:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Very interesting day.
* I started by trying to increase the entry wait time upon each consecutive
  loss as an attempt to combat consolidation reversals.
* This didn't work and lost ~$1K.
* Then I reverted the entry wait time to 30 seconds.
* Then tried to enter in the signal position's opposite on every odd-numbered
  loss. That didn't work.
* Then I tried contradicting the entry signal after two consecutive losses.
  This seemed to work. These were the results after 04:44:57 of runtime:

  ```
  Wins: 43 (55.13%) ‚Ä¢ Losses: 35 ‚Ä¢ Total: 78
  Loss Streak => Current: 2 ‚Ä¢ Longest: 4 ‚Ä¢ Counts: {1: 8, 2: 10, 3: 1, 4: 1}
  Win  Streak => Current: 0 ‚Ä¢ Longest: 6 ‚Ä¢ Counts: {1: 11, 2: 4, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 1}

  Current Balance: +360.37 ‚Ä¢ Max Balance: +615.45
  ```
* Note that 3 consecutive losses were averted TEN times. That's really significant.
* We'll see if this is the consolidation counter-measure that I've been seeking.
* I also increased the min max-loss ratio to 0.09% to allow more time to win.
* üö® **ALERT** Under NO circumstances should you run production until you can
  get to $30K in staging. üö®
* There were a few too many fetch quote lags, some may have cost wins again.
  It's possible that the quote endpoint isn't meant to be used as a realtime
  stream. WebSockets is still the way to go.
* I'm installing boost to use `boost/beast`'s websocket library. We'll see how it
  goes.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-05-10:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Day started off well but consolidation cleared gains.
* The fetch quote requests weren't particularly laggy either.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try
* Maybe simply close gains at 10am??
