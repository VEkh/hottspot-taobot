* Big bummer today ðŸ˜ž I accidentally started the app in production. Since it
  had succeeded in staging for the last five days, I figured it wouldn't be
  unreasonable to test it in production. Here were the results:

```
Wins: 89 (44.28%) â€¢ Losses: 112 â€¢ Total: 201
Loss Streak => Current: 1 â€¢ Longest: 8 â€¢ Counts: {1: 18, 2: 14, 3: 15, 4: 2, 5: 1, 8: 1}
Win  Streak => Current: 0 â€¢ Longest: 8 â€¢ Counts: {1: 30, 2: 9, 3: 9, 6: 1, 8: 1}

Current Balance: -1,472.32 â€¢ Max Balance: +589.71
```

* The day started at a near 5% loss then rebounded to its peak, which was again
  at around 9:30am, then lost for much of the rest of the day.
* A few thing seem apparent:
  1. Maybe I do need to implement a premature close algorithm -- I haven't seen
     an single day in the last week that has ended at its peak.
    * I can at least do this and push to production until I can figure out a
      way to make money throughout the whole day.
  2. I probably need to spread the risk across multiple securities -- I suppose
     it's possible that there's some fundamental disadvantage in production
     that staging obscures. However, I think it's more likely that either the
     retarded near-win polling interval was excessively increased, or that a
     low win percentage is simply possible.
     * By spreading the risk across multiple securities, you'll reduce the
       chances of one blowout loss undoing a whole day's gains for its
       siblings.

* Today's performance makes me want to abandon trying to come up with a
  premature exit strategy.
* First, it appears that the slower polling near wins is in fact weighting wins
  since a win rate <50% still results in a profit.
* I'm still astounded by how close to 50% the win rate is over time when using
  pure random as an entry indicator.. I still don't quite understand why, but
  this is the fifth day in a row.
* A few things seem apparent:
  1. The more plays the greater the return.
    * This suggests that an asset with fast moving price will generate more
      return over the long run.
    * This is also a good sign for Forex which would run indefinitely.
    * Maybe it also means that the risk should be spread across many
      securities.
  2. It still closed at a fraction of the peak.
    * Still not sure if this means a reasonable premature exit needs to be
      engineered.
    * If it is, maybe it's:
      If you've played more than 100 rounds and your win rate is > 50.0%?
    * The peaks were at 9:30am (again), 10am, and 10:30am.
    * Not sure if this is a coincidence.
  3. Weighting the wins seems to be working -- There's a higher return for
     lower win rates. We'll see how it performs tomorrow.

```

* The day started off with a 25% win rate in the first half hour.
* By 9:30am it had mostly recovered its losses.
* It then spent most of the day with a < 50% win rate until 2:20pm when it hit
  its peak. Its win rate at this time was ~52%.
* It then hit a couple loss streaks and ended at 47.86%, BUT it still profited
  0.01%.
* Slowing down the polling interval for near wins and accelerating it for near
  losses seems to have favorable weighted wins to the point that a less than
  50% win rate still resulted in a modest profit.
* The day's win rate was to be expected if other days' win rates were >50%.
* A few questions to answer:
  * What about days when the win rate is closer to 40%?
  * Is it possible to time a cash out point?
  * What would be the effect of alternating direction on each trade to achieve
    a true 1:1 ratio of buys and sells?
  * Would it be better to pick a stock like TSLA with more price action?
* If this strategy will almost always result in near 50% win rate, maybe it
  makes sense to construct an early termination algorithm that says something
  like the following:
  * If the max win rate has exceeded 60%,
  * and the return has exceeded 2.0%,
  * and the current return has lost 20% of its peak value,
  * then you should stop trading for the day.
* For that to make sense, I would have to never see a trading day end at its
  peak return.
* I have seen this, but it is far more rare than early / mid-day peaks.

  Wins: 55 (51.40%) â€¢ Losses: 52 â€¢ Total: 107

  Current Balance: +257.21 (+0.93%) â€¢ Max Balance: +775.07
  ```
* A pattern seems to be emerging -- the day's profits peak at ~10am CT. Today's
  profit peaked at 9:05am CT.
* If this pattern continues, consider terminating trading at that time until we
  can figure out a way to increase them throughout the day.
* Something to consider will also be how this will perform while running
  multiple instances of TaoBot.
* It's also great, but predicable, how close to a 50% win rate the coin flip
  brings about.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-05-16:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I implemented the Websocket stream and lags were successfully avoided.
* Here were the results:

  **STAGING**
  ```
  Wins: 70 (50.00%) â€¢ Losses: 70 â€¢ Total: 140
  Loss Streak => Current: 0 â€¢ Longest: 6 â€¢ Counts: {1: 15, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 3}
  Win  Streak => Current: 2 â€¢ Longest: 6 â€¢ Counts: {1: 15, 2: 8, 3: 5, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 1}

  Current Balance: +247.70 (+0.87%) â€¢ Max Balance: +1,346.55
  ```

* It's cool, but expected, that the win rate was exactly 50%. It's also cool
  that it still profited though it wouldn't have lasted too many more losses.

* Two wins in a row, which is great.
* I'm expecting that one or several days will have sub 50% win rates.
* To protect against this, I'd like the big wins to exceed the big losses.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try
* Shorten the round await interval during losses, and lengthen await time when
  winning.

### 2022-05-13:
#### Remarks
* I ran the first 45 minutes with the signal entry indicator, predicting a
  swing after the second loss. This was basically a wash.
* Then I reverted to a coin flip entry. This performed absurdly well:

  **STAGING**
  ```
  Wins: 66 (57.89%) â€¢ Losses: 48 â€¢ Total: 114
  Loss Streak => Current: 0 â€¢ Longest: 4 â€¢ Counts: {1: 15, 2: 4, 3: 7, 4: 1}
  Win  Streak => Current: 1 â€¢ Longest: 8 â€¢ Counts: {1: 11, 2: 9, 3: 2, 4: 3, 5: 1, 6: 1, 8: 1}

  Current Balance: +905.06 (~+3.3%) â€¢ Max Balance: +1,265.53
  ```

* This was with only 2x margin
* I think the reason why this worked much better than last time is that the
  stop profit and stop loss thresholds are roughly the same, and stop profit
  being flexible gives wins a bit more weight.
* I'll try this again on Monday with a WebSockets client streaming the quote
  prices. I'm still seeing positions exit or enter too late because of the
  laggy quote endpoint. Hopefully this will help improve performance.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Interesting, but confusing day.
* By ~10, TaoBot had earned $953.45. By the end of the day it was down
  -$2,160.01
* This was after experimenting with ways to counteract consolidation periods
  and taking profits that are 0.5 the loss.
* It's so odd that it can do so well at some times and so poorly during other
  times.
* I gotta figure out how to deal with consolidation.

### 2022-05-11:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Very interesting day.
* I started by trying to increase the entry wait time upon each consecutive
  loss as an attempt to combat consolidation reversals.
* This didn't work and lost ~$1K.
* Then I reverted the entry wait time to 30 seconds.
* Then tried to enter in the signal position's opposite on every odd-numbered
  loss. That didn't work.
* Then I tried contradicting the entry signal after two consecutive losses.
  This seemed to work. These were the results after 04:44:57 of runtime:

  ```
  Wins: 43 (55.13%) â€¢ Losses: 35 â€¢ Total: 78
  Loss Streak => Current: 2 â€¢ Longest: 4 â€¢ Counts: {1: 8, 2: 10, 3: 1, 4: 1}
  Win  Streak => Current: 0 â€¢ Longest: 6 â€¢ Counts: {1: 11, 2: 4, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 1}

  Current Balance: +360.37 â€¢ Max Balance: +615.45
  ```
* Note that 3 consecutive losses were averted TEN times. That's really significant.
* We'll see if this is the consolidation counter-measure that I've been seeking.
* I also increased the min max-loss ratio to 0.09% to allow more time to win.
* ðŸš¨ **ALERT** Under NO circumstances should you run production until you can
  get to $30K in staging. ðŸš¨
* There were a few too many fetch quote lags, some may have cost wins again.
  It's possible that the quote endpoint isn't meant to be used as a realtime
  stream. WebSockets is still the way to go.
* I'm installing boost to use `boost/beast`'s websocket library. We'll see how it
  goes.
