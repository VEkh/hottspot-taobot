###### Stats (PRODUCTION) (as of 2022-11-09)
* Win / Loss: 4W (Consecutive: 1) 3L (Consecutive: 0)

###### Notes
* A couple of unlucky same-facing coin flips made me miss out on much bigger
  profits, but c'est la vie. Sometimes you crap up, sometimes you crap down. At
  least I won today.

###### Next Thing(s) to Try
* I think it's time to implement the Forex heartbeat that restarts
  continuously. I'll do that this weekend.

###### Notes
* Nothing crazy to see here. Just a standard down day caused by AMZN and GOOG's
  early morning thrashing.
* These and large down days will occur, but so will standard and mega win days.

###### Stats (PRODUCTION) (as of 2022-11-09)
* Win / Loss: 3W (Consecutive: 2) 2L (Consecutive: 0)

###### Notes
* I earned 1.3% in the first 30 minutes, but got greedy and restarted.
* That could have been bad. It was down as much as -4.26%, but eventually won.
* The restart ended up winning after super profiting and staging closed down,
  so I ended up timing things well.
* You'll have to either be disciplined and accept early wins, or set a higher
  super profit reach goal.
* The super profit algorithm was worked as expected.

###### Stats (STAGING) (as of 2022-11-03)
* Win / Loss: 1W (Consecutive: 0) 2L (Consecutive: 2)

###### Notes
* Today was yesterday's opposite: it started crazy down (thanks TSLA 🙄), but
  eventually won a +2.32% round. More proof that you shouldn't close mega
  losses, as scary as it seems.
* I restarted and the second round lost -4%. The overall loss wasn't terrible,
  but it does make me want to adjust my profit securement strategy.

###### Next Thing(s) to Try
* Secure Profit Strategy
  * Each session should still operate with 1% trailing stop.
  * If, however, at any point you've _secured_ >= 2%, subsequent sessions
    should close (or not start) if half the max profit has been lost.

###### Notes
* What a crazy day!
* In the first 30 minutes it earned ~7%. The rest of the day, however was
  obliterated by TSLA's stubborn consolidation until the last 30 minutes of
  trading.
* All in all it was about break even, which is better than a mega loss. It was
  also cool to see mega win and mega loss all in one day 😅
* The loss round's max loss still didn't exceed 11%, so it's good to know that
  the best case scnario still outperforms the worst case. We'll keep watching.

###### Notes
* After two successful rounds of staging, I was feeling myself and turned on
  production...it won! 🎉🎊🥳
* I'm going to keep it live and see if I can take adavantage of this heavy
  price movement we've been having.
* I know, I know. I'll run into big loss days. Yesterday's +11% win and what
  would have been a comparable win last Friday give me confidence that big wins
  with the current iteration will overcome big losses.
* The day started with conslidation in almost all assets and led to max loss of
  -5.27% before the trend kicked in. If consolidation had continued, this loss
  would have increased.

###### Stats (STAGING) (as of 2022-11-03)
* Win / Loss: 1W (Consecutive: 1) 1L (Consecutive: 0)

###### Notes
* Two restarts failed with
```
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'nlohmann::detail::type_error'
what():  [json.exception.type_error.302] type must be number, but is null
```

* I think this is because I clear out account.json and it fails has trouble
  parsing it.
* Today's overall return was +5.47%. This was a solid return, but it was
  actually a day that could have been +10%. Add to that, one of the rounds
  returned +6.21% with a +7.27% peak. If I'm betting that big wins will make up
  for capped big losses (-4.5%), then days like these need to be as big as
  possible.
* The big win round happened after a -4.5% loss. I did, however, change
  strategies between rounds. If I had stopped trading after the loss, I would
  have missed out on BIG gains.
* I'm wondering if that still means that I should pause trading after the loss.
  I guess for now, I won't.
* Since waiting for breakouts still resulted in a -7% loss at the beginning of
  the week, I reverted to continuous trading.
* Here's where the algorithm stands:
  * Flip coin to start
  * Only close on losses. Hold wins.
  * Loss threshold is max(`25x long-term one-sec variance`, `1/4 the consolidation time's price range`)
  * Close round when the account max profit exceeds +1.05%, then breaches a 1%
    stop loss.
  * Close round if account loss exceeds -4.5%.
* The 1% account profit trailing stop is a really good amount. It's led to
  runaway profits and secures modest profits. It feels better to secure a win
  when the target is reached, even if it's a small win.

###### Notes
* I'm going to try a new max loss that is based on the consolidation period's
  time range. Specifically one-third of the range.
* Since I'm awaiting breakouts, I won't be missing out on entering in the
  opposite direction if I wait longer.
* This will incur larger losses when they do happen, but it will also help
  prevent premature closures.

###### Stats (STAGING) (as of 2022-10-17)
* Win / Loss: 7W (Consecutive: 0) 6L (Consecutive: 1)

###### Notes
* Today was the first day of re-introducing the max account loss. This time
  it's -4.5%. Alpha hit it and closed.
* I restarted Alpha and will watch.
* The idea is this:
  * Monday demonstrated that even by waiting for breakouts, it's still possible
    to lose <-7% in one day.
  * It seems safe to say that large losses are inevitable with any momentum
    strategy.
  * Days will therefore fall into one of four categories:
    * Massive gains (+4-10%)
    * Small gains (+1-2%)
    * Small losses (-1-2%)
    * Massive losses (-4-10%)
  * Assuming that these days are evenly distributed, this suggests that the
    strategy will break even in the long run.
  * However, if you limit the max loss days, then you can possibly skew overall
    performance in the gain direction.
* I'll have to wait a few weeks to see this play out, but overall profitability
  is still an open question.
* The Fed hiked interest rates by 0.75% again at 1pm and that sent the markets
  flying.
* The good news is that waiting for breakouts help keep loss to a minimum until
  the price finally broke out.

* 3/4 rounds won. All were moderate to little gains.
* The last round almost won.
* It's worth noting that a long hold for all positions would have resulted in
  the largest gain. A time-eased take profit function would have probably also
  done better. This is probably not worth the trade off of missing out on gains
  because of sharp reversal.

###### Notes
* It took five hourse, but Alpha finally won 😂
* This was a fantastic day for trying out the trailing stop approach to
  stopping the account profit. It allowed the lead to extend for several hours
  before closing at a legitimate correction point.
* It will help avoid missing out on highly attainable profits that rapidly
  reverse into loss.
* 1% is also an excellent trailing stop amount. It gave plenty of time for the
  profit to dip and eventually extend its max. 0.5% would have been too small.

###### Notes
* Round 1 surpassed the target, but reversed quickly then started
  consolidating. I'm tempted to change the account take profit algorithm to a
  simple trailing stop at 1.05% + .05%.
* This will have a consequence of prematurely closing before higher peaks are
  reached. It will also close an re-open into consolidation. It will, however,
  avoid sharp reversals that are never re-claimed.
* Whatever I decide with he take profit algorithm, I want to automate recording
  the round's performance and restarting all instances.

  next time.
* After the first ~30 min, the account balance was down < -5%. In addition to
  the glitch, the morning started with consolidation for all assets.
* If you're considering re-introducing the emergency brake, just know that it
  can hit in the first 30 min.
* TaoBot almost crossed profit territory at ~9:30am and again made a great run
  close to 2:30pm.
* This demonstrates that almost all consolidation time frames can lead to large
  max loss; -7.19% in this case.
* As a result, I'll reduce it to 45 minutes so a redemptive position can maybe
  open sooner.

###### Notes
* Alpha's API got jacked up until 08:46:01 and I had to restart at 9am after my
  shower. Good thing is that all assets were consolidating all morning anyway
  so I didn't miss much and may have saved some money.
* Today was a consolidation day through and through. There two bits of good news:
  1. During normal running, the loss was held to -4%. It was -5% in total with
     the morning's API mishap.
  2. The account profit peaked at +1.61%.
* It's hard to know whether this would have been a win under normal
  circumstances since we lost 10-15 minutes of the pivotal time of the day. I'd
  say change nothing and continue to observe.
* If you do change anything, it may be to increase the consolidation time
  frame. It seems to have slowed down the rate of loss.
* At some point you may want to consider moving to a more rapid take profit
  countdown.

* Win / Loss: 1W (Consecutive: 1) 1L (Consecutive: 0)

###### Notes
* Big win today! Everything worked as expected.
* Between Alpha and Beta, I shortened the consolidation time frame. This led to
  AMZN and GOOG having 16 and 18 loss losing streaks respectively. I'm going to
  extend it to 1.5 hours. This will further help slow profit attrition during
  consolidation.
* I'm also going to pause the exiting on big wins. I may reverse the decision
  again, but here's the thinking:
  * Every time you exit a position, you're opening yourself to loss
    consolidation at your exit point.
  * You could, however, also be missing out on an opportunity to ride the reversal.
  * This actually won't happen in the current iteration of TaoBot because it
    awaits consolidation breach before opening in the reverse direction.
  * If the range is still small and a position closes at a loss, then it can
    open in the opposite direction when the range is breached.
  * A premature close from a win can correct then return in the original
    direction. In this case, you're missing out on the profit you could have
    maintained and may even have incurred a loss in the meamtime.
  * It therefore makes sense simply hold and let the account take profit stop
    trading.
* It's worth noting that Beta would have won on two separate occasions if stop
  profit were enabled for it. I leave it on to learn how to minimize
  consolidation attrition. Maybe one day leaving TaoBot will consistently earn
  more than stopping profit. Until then, I'm happy closing it after the
  morning's profits.

* Win / Loss: 0W (Consecutive: 0) 1L (Consecutive: 1)

###### Notes
* Interesting day. To start the day, I had a bug in deciding whether to enter
  trades and their direction which made most trade direction decisions random.
  If the bug were absent, the day would have almost certainly resulted in a win.
* Today highlighted a few things:
  1. A day of almost nonstop consolidation can result in a loss of 5%, even if
    you're waiting for breakouts.
  2. Early morning success is key.
  3. Waiting longer to take profit is key. I'm still not sure if 100x one-sec
     variance is right, but if TSLA had never closed, it would have profited.
     There are scenarios, however, where not closing would be disadvantageous.
  4. This is good reason to not run the app all day and keep the time-eased
     take profit algorithm: after early morning gains, price often
     consolidates with no new trends forming. This _will_ incur heavy losses.
  5. Consolidation is a fact of life. You'll have to re-introduce the max
     account loss at some point. The difference is that since it takes longer
     to realize large losses, you can perhaps feel more assured that most of
     the day has past before it triggers.

* Win / Loss: 1W (Consecutive: 0) 4L (Consecutive: 4)

###### Notes
* Okay, the high-frequency, small profit approach failed miserably, and on a
  heavy trend day no less.
* I'm going to revert to a long hold strategy for the advantages I cited a
  couple months ago.
* On most days, the price for each security _does_ pick a direction toward
  which it trends for the day's remainder.
* Even if this isn't the case for one, it usually is for one or more other
  assets.
* The difference is that I have two things now:
  1. A time-eased account take profit that should help secure diminishing
     profits.
  2. I'll await 1-hour range breakouts to help avoid consolidation triggering
     heavy losses.
* You may think this won't work on Forex where the prices seem to fluctuate
  less, but you can close positions at the end of each day (4pm CT).
  * Closing positions at really high profits could also help.

###### Notes
###### Next Thing(s) to Try
* Round 2 started with crazy trending, but got crushed by shallow consolidation
* Hooray! This `Tight Stop Loss With Expanding Trailing Stop` approach is
  showing promise. It won two consecutive times 🎉
* It keeps the losses manageable while waiting for explosive runs. It was good
  to see a +6.60% max even though it was during long trending, which didn't
  start til almost 1.75 hours into trading.
* The t-stop max of 10x 1-sec variance was too tight, so I increased it to 15x.
  This was to loose, so I shrank it to 12.5x.
* I also shortened the account level take profit half life to close sooner.
* I suspect that this algorithm will work better during periods of higher
  volatility, and I may want to consider limiting it to periods when volatility
  is > 1.
* It's really interesting to see assests go from being major losers to major
  winners and vice versa.
* For now, I'll keep watching and look out for another full consolidation day.
* If this works, it would be the real trend riding algorithm I've been trying
  to build 🤠

* Today was the mega loss that invalidated using momentum reversals as

* I'm going to switch up and try to only trade during breakout times. It will
  still be wrong enough times, but should never be as catastrophic trying to
  ride intraday trends during consolidation.

* Only trade during breakout moments:
  1. Keep only the quotes from the last hour +
  2. Only open trades when the price is lower than the lowest support level, or
     higher than the highest resistance level.

* Looks like I'll need to refine the resistance and support alorithms to make

* I think was saved by long trends, but who knows? Maybe I fully capitalized on
  them because I got in right at the beginning of the breakout because of the
  momentum reversal points.
* I also missed some of TSLA's biggest gains in the morning because of a HUGE
  overnight price change. I modified the price aberration algorithm and
  restarted.

  await time between rounds didn't increase significantly.

* However, when I turned it on in Beta, TaoBot did exceedingly well after
  running for about 30 minutes. I forgot to record the performance.
* I decided to return to alpha and it won two separate rounds! 🎈
* There was a mix of consolidation and trending in both rounds.
* I need more time to observe this strategy's effectiveness.
* I'm temporarily stopping the max loss emergency brake until I can get a sense
  of how well this works.
* I'm still unsure as to whether I'll only use the momentum reversal points to
  predict positions after losses. I gotta keep watching, but it's a promising start!

###### Notes
* Okay! The momentum shift collection ran pretty well. Now it's time to make
  decisions with them.
* I'll start by using them to make a decision after every position closes. I
  may end up only using them after losses.
* Here's the plan for resistance and support levels:
  * Assign a score to each one that is a product of the current `price_delta`
    and current `time_delta`.
  * Since I want to reward proximity, I'll score the inverse of each delta
  * Since there will likely be many points that match the current price, set
    the max `price_delta` score to 100.
  * Pick the reverals point with the highest score.
  * If the current price is above it, buy, if below, sell.

* Next stop is still figure out how to use resistance and support levels to
  trade during consolidation.

###### Notes
* The quest for consolidation profitability continues.
* Most assets except TSLA spent the morning consolidating and ultimately lost
  after 3.5 hours.
* However, when I turned on Beta after reducing both the stop loss threshold
  and take profit algorithm's half life, prices started trending and Beta won.
* TaoBot succeed today and yestderday in Beta where the price started trending
  after a long morning of consolidation. I take solace in the fact that it can
  ride long trends.
* I'm still struggling to figure out how to successfully ride consolidation.
* I'm back to a very shallow loss, with long positive trend ride strategy.
* Assuming this fails during consolidation, I think the next step will be to
  come up with an algorithm that constructs likely resistance and support
  levels.
* After doing that, I'll use them to make buy and sell decisions.

###### Notes
* What a day! 😵
* The morning started again in crippling consolidation. This is the second or
  third consecutive day like this.
* The micro position approach helped delay the failure, but the day's movement
  was still too static for profit.
* Then the Fed incrased interest rates again and sent the markets flying. At
  first this triggered crippling loss. Then I reverted the `micro position`
  approach to full buying power and the resulting profit ensued.
* I'm reintroducing GOOG and QQQ because I think their movement would have
  saved today.
* The position time ease function was too slow in exiting profitable positions.
  I shortened the half life to 5 min and increased the decay rate.
* I realized the problem with the micro-position strategy: it's essentially a
  regression to using distance traveled as an entry indicator. As I've
  demonstrated many times, this is not a good entry indicator. It also makes
  you miss out on early entry in trend periods.

###### Next Thing(s) to Try
* Go back to full buying power on all positions with the four fastest moving assets.
* Let's see if the accelerated team easing tkake profit algorithm helps
  increase profitability during consolidation periods.
* I also set the loss and extra take profit threhsolds to 25x 1-sec variance.

###### Notes
* Morning got thrashed by high amplitude consolidation.
* I turned on beta right as the prices had finally decided their trend
  direction. It profited.
* This made me think: what if you kept stakes very low in the morning with
  1-quantity orders until the price picked its direction? Then close the
  winning the position and maximize stakes.
* Pros and Cons to this approach:
  * Pros
    * Avoid crippling early morning losses
  * Cons
    * Miss out on big early morning gains
* If you extended this to always slash stakes after a loss what will eventually
  happen is a series of big loss, small win cycles where the wins could have
  overcome losses, but couldn't because of the diluted quantity.
* I think, however, that some attempt to reserve max proportional buying for
  when the price is trending in the win direction will be a cool thing to
  attempt.

###### Next Thing(s) to Try
**Turbo Wins, Deflate Losses**
1. Start with a micro order size, one share
2. Wait for a position that is profiting by the same amount as the stop loss
   threshold.
3. Close the winning position and open again with the max buying power
   available to the asset.
4. Ride the profit with the time-eased trend riding algorithm.
5. When the position closes, open a new position with the micro quantity, win
   or lose, and repeat steps 1-4.
  * Even if the position loses, at least the previous micro order(s) prevented a
    bigger cumulative loss.
  * If you win, still continuing with a micro order will help avoid a
    subsequent loss that eats into the profit you just earned. If it continues
    in the same trend direction, you'll close and open at max size anyway.

* It happened again!!! 😭
* After six straight days of success, a week of losses cleared out all the
  profit I made.
* This is is what's happening:
  1. TaoBot profits heavily during an extended trend period.
  2. I get excited and think that it will always work.
  3. I run it in production.
  4. Shortly after running it in production, the markets enter an extended
     consolidation period.
  5. TaoBot loses lots of money and I run back to the drawing board.
* Each production run has followed almost this exact pattern.
* What I realilze, however, is that TaoBot does in fact work, just not during
  consolidation. This makes sense since it's a momentum algorithm.
* I suspect that by leaving it on, it will eventually start making money again,
  once the market starts to decisively trend.
* What is still accurate, however, is that I think the current iteration is the
  best intraday, long trend rider that I've built. On days when it's working
  properly, you can earn upwards of 5-6%.
* What I haven't done well, up until now, is lose properly.
* If I accept that there will be down days, I must also cap their severity.
  There were two days this week that resulted in ~7% losses. This is
  unacceptable.
* This is why I've introduced a hard stop at 4% loss. Looking at past
  performance, very rarely has a profitable day experienced a 4% loss at any
  point.
* If return has dipped below 4%, it typically won't profit that day. It _may_
  reduce by closing time, but I've also seen it expand unchecked.
* If this strategy is to be profitable, I have to accept losses and cut them
  before they become too devastating.

###### Next Thing(s) to Try
* I'm fairly confident that in a macro sense, this strategy is profitable.
  These are the next steps I'll take to demonstrate this:
  1. **Revert to staging** -- Even though I'm confident that this strategy will
     work in production, it's still possible that I'm wrong. It doesn't make
     sense to risk real money before answering this question definitively.
  2. **Hard stop account losses** -- Introduce a hard account stop-loss with no
     conditions around time of day, volatility, volume etc.. I recommend -4%.
    * On most profit days, it will be very apparent early on that the day will
      profit.
  3. **Change nothing** -- Or at least little to nothing else about the
     algorithm, unless it is to make it more capable at riding long intraday
     trends. In other words, maximize the algorithm's earning potential on its
     most opportune days.
    * This will create plenty of padding for the extended consolidation days
      that WILL occur.
  4. **Reduce traded assets** -- Here's my current thinking. At first I thought
     it made sense to trade multiple assets to hedge against the poor
     performance of any one asset. However, by trading more assets, you're also
     introducing liability -- a well performing asset can be offset by a poorly
     performing one. My current thinking is that I should just trade the one or
     two fastest moving assets since their larger absolute price movement is
     more track for TaoBot to ride. I may be wrong about this, but we'll see.
  5. **Loss padding** -- Set the account balance to an amount that allows for 5
     consecutive days at the max allowed loss (-4%). This is $30K.
  6. **Observe** -- Observe overall performance through at least a couple of
     trend-consolidation cycles.
     * Watch it succeed _and_ fail as maximally as possible to get a sense of
       whether it is still profiting after a failure period.
  7. **Launch** -- If after a couple trend-consolidation cycles I've made
     money, launch in production after bringing its account balance to the same
     padded level.

###### Notes
* Forex ran all week! 🎉 That's pretty cool.
* The down side is that it ended pretty much near its lowest point.
* What this suggests is that a contiguous momentum strategy is inherently
  unprofitable.
* What _may_ be true, however, is that it can be profitable for short amounts
  of time. Most currency pairs, enjoyed at least a brief moment of profit.
  * It is worth noting, however, that a major 6% inflation announcement early
    in the week sent prices flying in a way that was profitable to some. I
    can't imagine that this happens often.
* Let's reduce the currency pairs. Here are their price movement to price ratios:

  loss helps avoid mega losses and makes the strategy overall profitable.

* Still running without incident, which is good.
* I think in addition to only trading the currencies with the highest price
  movment, I'll only trade during periods of high volatility.

* Win / Loss: 3W (Consecutive: 0) 2L (Consecutive: 1)

###### Notes
* TSLA saved AMZN and GOOG's horrific showing, which re-emphasizes the need for
  spreading risk across several assets.
* It's time to re-introduce the max account loss algorithm.
* It will exit when volatility has fallen below 0.5 and the account loss
  exceeds -2%.
* From what I've observed, the account will rarely win after that point.
* This approach of the max loss has a couple advantages:
  1. It isn't just a magic number loss percentage that can be triggered during
     early morning volatility.
  2. It gives ToaBot sufficient time (usually 1-3 hours) to win, which it
     usually has by the time volatility and volume have significantly
     diminished.
  3. It will help cap losses to reasonable levels so that routine and mega wins
     can lead to long-term profit.
* After each loos, I'll still turn on staging without clearing performance. If
  the loss threshold is correct, TaoBot should go on to lose more money on most
  days.
* If it seems that it is prematurely exiting, I'll increase the loss threshold.

###### Stats (as of 2022-09-08)
* Win / Loss: 3W (Consecutive: 1) 1L (Consecutive: 0)

###### Notes
* 6.3% inflation was announced today and stock prices plummeted
* The good news is that I won. Bad news is I missed out on what could have been
  my longest contiguous trend ride to date 😭.
* Today's trend patterns were pretty ideal for the momentum algorithm, but I
  prematurely closed twice.
* This suggests that I excessively shortened the take profit easing function's
  half life.
* To compensate, I'll try to increase the easing function's upper bound each
  time a new max is reached. This should buy the price more time to continue in
  the trend direction.
* This will necessarily reduce the max take profit, but will hopefully increase
  the overall profit that it takes each day.
* This increasing the upper bound doesn't work, I'll increase the half life to
  45 minutes from 30 minutes.

###### Notes
* Okay today was just about as bad as it will reasonably get 😭
* There was almost never a profit and the day spent most of its time
  consolidating.
* I thought that even in this scenario, losses would be contained to 2-4%, but
  I was wrong.
* I'm not going to change anything for now.
* One thing I'd like to monitor is whether a time-based emergency brake makes
  sense.
* I've observed that generally, TaoBot doesn't make money past the day's
  halfway point. Almost all profit peaks are observed within the first half of
  the day.
* If that's the case, it would make sense shut it down after halfway point, if
  the loss is beneath a certain threshold, perhaps 2%.
* During the rest of the week, I'll confirm or refute this and implement a
  time-based emergency brake at the end of the week.
* I'll probably be able to tolerate one or two more down days. I guess I'll
  just see if those happen this week.
* Don't forget the last 6 profit days!

###### Notes
* Hooray! 🎉 That's two days of winning since being back on production.
* Though both win days had extensive trending, they had their fair share of
  consolidation so it seems like a decent indicator of future performance.
* I'll feel more comfortable once I see it struggle through a few more
  consolidation days.
* I have noticed, however, that each win closed at or below half the peak. This
  is because the take profit easing function is allowing too much time for the
  peak to be exceeded.

###### Next Thing(s) to Try
* Shorten the half life of the account profit take profit time easing function.
  * This may lead to lead to missed profit extension opportunities. If so,
    increase it from 30 to 45 minutes.

  non-stop.
* I'll both observe the net return and which are the four fastest moving
  currencies so I can focus on those.
* Since equity assets tend to lose money over time, I'm guessing currencies
  will be similar.
* If this is the case, it doesn't necessarily mean that Forex can't win, I'll
  just have to figure out another way.

* Running  Oanda for 6.5 hours didn't result in as much loss as I thought it
  would!
* `EUR_CAD` and `USD_CAD` both had 13 loss streaks but `EUR_USD` and `USD_JPY`
  only had 4 and 3 loss streaks respectively, so I'm not sure if this warrants
  increasing the loss thresholds.
* I simply need to let Oanda run for a whole week and see what the results are.

##### Stocks/ETFs
* GREAT first day back in production!! 🎉
* It's a bummer that about half the peak was lost though 😕
* I wonder if this means I should shorten the take profit easing period for the
  account profit.
* I'll watch a couple more days before pulling the trigger.
* We'll see how it goes tomorrow.

#### Remarks
##### Forex
* Forex has been running well for the last couple of days.
* I actually may have accidentally fixed that mysterious leftover shares issue
  that plagued Oanda. It was looking for `tradesClosed` in the place order
  response for closing trades.
* I'll keep monitoring and increasing the quantities until each position is
  maxxing the account's buying power.
* The main observation to make is whether Forex profits over time.
* I suspect that prices spend most of their time consolidating so throughout
  the week there will probably be a net negative balance across all assets.
* I could, however, be wrong. Even if I am, I may be able to work out a
  time-eased account profit targeting scenario like I do for equities.

##### Stocks/ETFs
* GREAT day. The morning witnessed two _heavy_ trend periods that lead to a
  very high peak.
* This suggests that a two things are working well:
  1. Time eased profit targeting, both at the asset and account balance
     level.
  2. Trading fewer, high price-action assets.
* I'm almost ready to re-try this in production. I just need to see one or two
  more days where all assets consolidate almost all day, to see what profit
  peaks hit and what kind of loss I can expect.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I started with incorrect math that prevented the account balance form closing
  closer to the peak. Luckily the math worked out well enough that it could
  close when the profit resurged to the minimum threshold, hence the win.
* I corrected the math, restarted in Beta, and the target profit easing was
  working at the account level.
* Since I started Beta during a consolidation period that never broke, it lost
  money, but not before peaking at a respectable profit.
* I may adjust the target profit easing rates and further reduce the number of
  trading assets, but I think I may be at another working iteration that I'll
  monitor next week.

* Holding win positions for a long time is still working well.
* I'm introducing a new concept: Sigmoid-Eased Peak Profit Expansion
* The way it works is as follows:
  * Set target profit
  * When that target is reached, extend it
  * The new target profit will sigmoidally diminish over a calibrated time to a
    specified minimum.
* This approach allows profits to reach their natural maxima and gives them
  sufficient time to extend them. The diminish period is 1 hour for each asset
  position, two hours for the account's daily profit.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I can't properly count today's results as wins because the peaks resulted
  from luckily timed restarts.
* What was apparent, however, were a few things:
  * Long holding profits is a good idea that helps avoid unnecessary double
    losses.
  * The timed diminishing profit target was also an excellent idea. I modified
    it to use the order's `max_profit_timestamp` instead of the order's start
    timestamp. This way it can reset as the profit hits new peaks.
  * I'm also reducing the target max profit hold time from two hours to one.
  * It's still a toss up whether a win should trigger a reversal. A reversal
    seemed more correct today. I'll try again for tomorrow.
  * I think a 40x 1-sec loss threshold prevents jumpiness during periods of
    lower volatility, but I think a smaller exit threshold will be better for
    high volatility periods. The morning lost heavily because of large loss
    thresholds that triggered.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try
* Small loss threshold during high volatility, high loss threshold during low
  volatility.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Rough day again. No considerable profit was realized despite a day of strong
  trending.
* The trailing stop is still working as intended.
* Loss positions are still being held too long and much of the max profit is
  lost to a deep trailing stop.
* At the end of the day I reduced the exit threshold to the smallest it's ever
  been: 10x 1-sec variance.
* It peaked at a profit of ~ +1.1% and seemed to be riding short-term trends as
  intended.
* We'll start tomorrow with this iteration and see how it goes.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I had to break Round 1. In the morning it dropped to -5.58% loss. After the
  bear trend broke it shot up back to +0.38% profit. This was encouraging,
  suggesting that even if it lost heavily, it could also gain heavily. However,
  after several more hours of running, consolidation periods had drained the
  profit back down to -3.09% loss. This shouldn't have been the case given how
  strongly the price was trending for all assets. It suggested that the exit
  threshold was still too shallow.
* Reset the account's balance to $30K and increased the exit threshold to 40x
  1-sec variance.
* This profited, however the prices were still trending significantly, so it's
  hard to tell how effective it truly was. We'll see on Monday how it goes.
* Have a good weekend! You'll figure this out!

* This didn't perform well and I reverted to the opening strategy with the same
  increased exit threshold.
* Try not to break and hold even if the morning is off to a bad start.

  * Cuts loss soon enough to ride reversals, but not so soon that it triggers
    frivolously.
* There were also very good win streaks:
  * AAPL: 1

  * MSFT: 4
  * QQQ: 4
  * TSLA: 7
* I was watching the exit points and I really think that a 20x 1-sec variance
  is the Goldie Locks exit threshold. I'd _strongly_ suggest that I don't
  change it as I'm observing over the next several days.
* This iteration is pretty close to what I've been trying to build.
* Starting tomorrow, I'll measure it's daily performance and see if I can set a
  realistic daily target profit.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I started the day with trying to ride short trends but the stop loss was too
  tight and triggered too much loss.
* I loosened them and set the target win to 35x 1-sec variance with a 15x 1-sec
  variance trailing stop. This actually worked pretty well and got to a +2.09%
  return.
* This iteration ended at a slight loss after a hectic conslidation period, but
  I still felt it left too much profit on the table.
* I'm now solely using the trailing stop to make profit. That is, the profit
  starts once the trailing stop is exceeded.
* The trailing stop is 15x 1-sec variance.
* This should still successfully ride trends to their reasonable end, but it
  will also take smaller profits sooner.
* It still remains to be seen whether placing an opposite trade post-win is
  better than placing a same-direction trade.
* I still feel confident I can figure something out that attains a >1-2% daily
  profit, even on consolidation days.

```

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Today started with modest trending, hence the early peak.
* I'm going to try some new things.
* I think a good takeaway from the last few weeks is that you should be patient
  in stopping wins. The ideal is that I can follow wins to their true
  reversal points.
* What's been hard in the past few weeks is figuring out the proper stop win
  threshold. Is it 40x, 80x, or 150x the 1-sec variance? What about legitimate
  smaller scale trends that occur while waiting for that target point?
* I'm going to re-visit maximizing profits by:
  1. Riding a trend to its true end.
  2. Waiting for it to reverse by an amount equal to the loss amount.
  3. Opening a position in the opposite direction.
* This will be challenging for periods when the price is trending in one
  direction with intermittent sharp corrections. However, the loss threshold
  expansion during heightened volatility should help counteract this.
* I'm not sure how successful this will be, but it will be interesting to see.

* Most securities have a hard time reaching 120 or 150x 1-sec variance in

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* 0/6 won again today 😳.
* Something interesting is happening.
* This is the first time in weeks (maybe in a month) where there have been two
  consecutive big loss days.
* It's max loss almost reached -6% which has been unheard of for the last
  several weeks.
* I think what's happening is this:
  * Right now most assets are hitting a resistance point to the bull run of the
    last couple of weeks.
  * This consolidation period is kryptonite to a momentum strategy.
* This doesn't mean that this consolidation period will last indefinitely.
  However, it does demonstrate that it can and will occur for multiple days.
* It's scary. My knee jerk instinct is to shut everything down and observe
  staging for more time, but I can't ignore the success of the last two weeks.
  Remember, in all take balance profit scenarios, TaoBot made money.
* However, I think it will be more wise to weather the storm, even if it means
  putting more money in, once the $25K threshold is breached.
* This may demonstrate the need for spreading the risk between equities and
  currencies.
* OR maybe the tough fact that this strategy will ultimately break even or lose
  money, no matter how long of a period of profitability it demonstrates.

##### Stocks/ETFs
* Uhhh WEIRD day 😳
* The day OPENED with a few things in the Alpha account:
  1. A +6% gain 🎉
  2. A severely slashed margin buying power 😵
  3. A margin buying power multiplier that remained `4`.
  4. A large AMD position that had been open all of yestderday and into today
     because of order cancellation segfaults I was debugging on Friday.
* This created a bizarre, but interesting scenario:
  * Normally the buying power is the lesser of `margin buying power` and
    `(balance * margin multiplier (4)) / number of assets traded`.
  * At the beginning of the day, `margin buying power` and `balance * margin
    multiplier` are roughly equivalent, so if the balance-multipler product is
    used, there will be enough buying power for all trades. Let's call this
    product the Presumed Buying Power.
  * This morning, however, the divvied Presumed Buying Power (~$18K per asset)
    was still less than the actual avaialable buying power (~$68K), but not
    enough to open trades for each asset with the presumed amount (i.e. $18K *
    6 >> $27K * 4)
  * As a result, most assets opened below their anticipated quantities and TSLA
    couldn't ever open a position.
* I'm fairly sure that this was all because the AMD position was open overnight
  and all will return to normal tomorrow.
* It does make me wonder, however, if I should adjust the quantity algorithm to
  deal with only the available margin buying power.
* After an hour, I finally resolved to run the app on `Beta` to see if it could
  still profit. While it didn't hit the big targets, it still kept the loss
  small, less than the target 2-4% range.

##### Stocks/ETFs
* Had a rough start, but had a very healthy peak. It ultimately ended in
  shallow green.
* I may want to think of a time-based stop profit algorithm:
  * Target 4.25% at the start
  * If it hasn't reached this by 11:45pm (?) target max - (n * 1)% for n hours
    after the halfway point.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* 6/6 won today 🎉
* Though the day was marked by strong extended trends, there was good variety
  in movement.
* If I had closed at 4%, I would have missed out on ~2% gain.
  * This is interesting. It's still unclear whether I should always let TaoBot
    run all day because of this outcome, or if I should always close at 4+%
    since some days close below 4%.
  * Maybe I'll run 4+% Close on production and All Day Run on staging.
* It's good that I didn't change the algorithm after yestderday's loss.
* Yesterday's loss supported what I already knew: since this is a
  momentum-based algorithm, it will fail on days that spend most if not all day
  consolidating. The prevalence of these days remains in question.
* Longest loss streaks before final position:
  * AAPL (4)
  * AMZN (3)
  * MSFT (3)

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Very interesting day. 1/6 won.
* Every asset started the day with thrashing consolidation and didn't
  significantly trend throughout the rest of the day.
* This can and does happen. I'm not sure that there's anything that a
  momentum-based approach can do against this.
* What is encouraging, however, is that the current iteration still keeps loss
  between -3-4%.
* Change nothing and continue to observe. Remember, before today, the last four
  consecutive days peaked at >4%.
* The trend that I'm seeing since the 07/29 iteration is that gains/losses will
  be somewhere between +/- 2-4%, and will peak slightly beyond that in most
  cases.
* Continue to observe if this is true, until next Wednesday. If it is, turn on
  the take profit at the 4.25 (0.2 trailing stop level).
* It will still be wise of you to wait for a $30K account balance before going
  live.

* Great day today! 5/6 assets won.
* There was a strong bull trend for most assets, but the algorithm also rode
  more turbulent price movements well.
* The increased loss threshold DEFINITELY helped avoid excessively long loss
  streaks during consolidation periods. The longest loss streaks were GOOG (5) and TSLA (4)
* The reduced take profit threshold was enough to secure profits. It couldn't
  secure a bear trend profit, but it was still good.
* This is the fourth consecutive day with a max greater than 4%. I still have
  yet to see whether I should use it as a target profit, or if  I should keep
  trying to end the day at the max profit.
* I'll observe for a couple more days.
* I'm getting really close to a stable version ready for production 🔥.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* 4/6 won and this is the third consecutive day with a max gain of > 4%. That's
  really good!
* This peak and the positive return were DEFINITELY a result of securing a
  profit after 200x 1-sec variance.
* This allowed almost all assets to profit on the bull and bear trends.
* I try reducing the take profit to 150x 1-sec variance because 200x seemed
  like a bit much.
* MSFT never won and lost 9 times. Yesterday TSLA similarly lost 7 times. I'm
  not sure if increasing the loss threshold will decrease the loss likelihood.
* It's worth a shot but I'll keep it at 30x and first observe how the 150x
  secure profit works.

* GREAT peak again today that hit at ~10am CT.
* However, everyone's trends started to reverse and TSLA ran into a 7-streak
  loss at the inflection point.
* It's still a win because the max balance was exceptional, but I'm going to
  see if securing a very large win in hopes of following a reversal trend will
  help lead to open-ended gains.
* If it still doesn't by the end of the week, I may look at the average max
  balance and re-implement a stop profit loss strategy.

* MAJOR ENHANCEMENT 🚨
* What a day! 🚨I made the change to stop taking profits and it really seems to
  have paid off.
* 3/6 won with a total ~3% return
* Each asset held the winning position for the following time after respective
  losses:
  * AAPL: 04:14:13 • 4 L
  * AMZN: 06:20:34 • 2 L
  * GOOG: 06:28:54 • 0 L

  * TSLA: 06:28:54 • 0 L
* This strategy _definitely_ saves money that was lost when following bull and
  bear trends that would end up in reversals.
* What remain to be seen are:
  * How often the day will end in profit?
  * Will this be similar to past reslts with a consistently higher max?
  * If / when this loses, how major will the loss be?
* It's important to note that today was an exceptionally successful day because
  of strong trending for much of the day for most assets. We'll see how normal

  was still > -4%.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try
* I had an interesting idea: What if instead of taking profits, you left them
  open ended?
* When you take a profit one of a few things will happen:
  1. The price will soon reverse and continue in the opposite direction, thus
     nullifying the gain.
  2. The price will keep going in the profit direction. In this case you would
     have been better off staying in the position since closing and opening
     necessitates a brief pause in gains.
  3. The price reverses, triggers a loss, then reverses again to continue in
     the original direction.
* In cases 2 & 3, you would have been better off staying in the orignal
  position, so maybe TaoBot only closes enough times for the day's trend to
  establish itself.
* If not the day's trend, then a long enough trend to reach the account's
  target profit.
* I'll have to leave TaoBot on all day for the next several days to record the
  results, but it's possible that this will result in similar if not greater
  returns.

* VERY important: The profit only slipped ~-1% when the Fed announced interest

  * Usually this kicks of heavy volatility and destroys profit.
* This is also the fourth consecutive where the price meaningfully trended for
  some portion of the day.
  * This bodes well for Forex whose TaoBots will be running contiguously.
* On three of the last four days, running all day resulted in loss.

* I started the day by setting the exit threshold at 60x one-sec variance after
  the first 20x position.
* Most assets started the day with tall consolidation that took the loss down
  to -3.84%
* However, they all started trending downward and the profit increased to
  +1.97%.
* This confirms the suspicion that I should just leave on TaoBot and seek the
  exit threshold that rides general trends.
* Even the max loss wasn't as severe as I've seen.
* Try 60x for a few days and see if >=75x is better.

  if the day happens to be a long trend day.

  an exit threshold that keeps losses to a minimum on consolidation days?

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I was in FL and didn't properly record the cross-asset win rate.
* It seems that I can almost always earn at least 1%.
* The current plan is to target a 1.05% return with .1% trailing stop that
  expands to a 0.5, or maybe 1% trailing stop.
* This could perhaps help take advantage of large win days.
* The stop loss will be 3%.

  need to lose a stop loss that matches the stop profit.
* I'll need more data to determine what the appropriate thresholds are. Right

  * QQQ:  +$398.76   🥉

  * TSLA: +$1,132.91 🥇
* I'm toying with the idea of only trading the highest cash flow assets.
  However, if I had done that today with AMZN and TSLA on the beta account, I
  would have been down.
* It's probably best to continue spreading the risk across multiple assets.

* After the main account closed and restarted on the beta account, here was its
  return:
  * Today's Max Gain:  $29,360.52 (+386.44)  (+1.33%)
  * Today's Max Loss:  $25,470.13 (-$685.07) (-2.36%)
  * Return (STAGING):  +$55.31 (+0.19% Account)

* The assets spent much time consolidating and some time trending so this
  tracks.

#### Friday Report
* All in all, today was a good week. 3/4 days won, two of them met / exceeded
  the trailing stop daily threshold.
* It still remains to be seen whether cycling through the exit thresholds helps
  eliminate or reduce the gravity of loss days.
* This is a good intro into the weekend and MiniConf week.

#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* The morning started with the exact movement that would lead to major loss:
  consolidation at the exact height of the exit prices.
* When the -5% emergency brake fired, I restarted with an adjustment:
  * Cycle through a series of 1-sec variance multipliers: 20x, 30x, 40x.
* After a couple of hours it was actually profiting. Then at 1pm, volatility
  spiked and started incurring loss.
* However, by the end of the day it was about +0.5% from the restart.
* We'll see if this is an adequate defense against sharp fluctuations or I just
  got lucky with trending.

  * TSLA: +$409.60 🥇
* The target profit was reached and the trailing stop was breached but didn't
  exit for two reasons:
  1. Not all instances of TaoBot recorded the attained target proft before the
     profit had slipped.
  2. `should_close_position` wasn't closing if the `should_stop_profit` is true
* I've made the appropriate changes and will run on the Hedge account for the
  rest of the day to compare results and see if I can figure out a way to
  profit during consolidation.

  didn't profit in the morning.
* It almost did, but actually ended up near the day's high at day's end.
* This dashes some confidence, but I still think it's worth trying it for
  several days and observing results.

  * Record the max profit.
  * Enhance the stop slipping profit algorithm to be able to close mid-trade, OR,
    * To stop when the cumulative target profit has been reached. Not just the
      target for each individual asset.
* Again, exit price expansion during high volatility worked well, so keep that.
* 40x 1-sec variance is still working well as each sample size increases, so
  I'll probably stay here. However, MSFT still hit a 5-loss losing streak,
  bolstering the long loss inevitability theory.

* 4/6 could have cashed out at 2% return, but they had to wait til 3pm.
* AAPL, one of the two who couldn't, almost just reached the 2% target.
* High volatility expansion of the exit thresholds worked well.
* I'm now waiting for each price movement average to reach 500K samples. Each
  symbol averages about 40-50K per day.
* As movement slowed, the thresholds shrank. This shrinkage should diminish as
  the average's sample size increases.
* I'll probably need to increase the coefficient as the one-sec variance
  averages decrease.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-06-23:
#### Remarks
* Started the day with non-expanding exit prices (only 40x long-term one-sec
  variance) and got raped.
* Resolved: You MUST always expand the exit thresholds as volatility spikes. If
  not, you WILL lose lots of money.
* In fact, this is probably why the interest rate announcements wipe you out,
  and that's why stopping the algorithm when volatility exceeds an threshold
  amount makes sense.
* We'll see if the increased sample size of the long-term one-sec variance
  mixed with volatility expansion works better tomorrow.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-06-22:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Day started off with good trending that would have probably led to a win if I
  was staking the full amount. However, I was instead staking just one unit per
  trade.
* Consolidation later in the day led to the max loss.
* I'm going to increase the max sample size for the price movement to 100K to
  see if I can get a more static average and use a fixed multiple of that
  throughout the day.

### 2022-06-22:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Time based exits didn't work.
* Reverted to one-sec variance. This performed okay.
* Gonna see how this is again while preventing trade opening when volatility is
  >= 3.0
* How does it peform across days? Should I just do martingale across days?
* Maybe you can demonstrate that it profits over a long time and take to Oanda?

### 2022-06-15:

##### Stocks/ETFs
* Interesting day.
* The fed raised interest rates at 1pm which sent prices crazy.
* One-sec variance volatility hit absurd highs:
  * AMZN - Short-term ~1000% the long-term
  * TSLA - Short-term ~800% the long-term
  variance.
* In this instance and in prior similar outlier events, TaoBot has tended to
  perform very poorly.
* I'll compare this to the morning's volatility fluctuations and set a maximum
  volatility condition to opening a position.
* I still have high confidence in this algorithm's success potential. What the
  interest rate hike demonstrates is that it still struggles in periods of
  immense volatility.
* I'll either have to figure out how to handle these heightened volatility
  periods, or just keep out during them.

* Re-introduced martingale has won two days in a row now. Today was greater

  Current Balance: +84.51 • Max Balance: +139.67
  Current Loss Streak Deficit: +0.00 • Total Deficit: -55.16
  ```

* Observation: I used to think that martingale would only work if you never
  reached the max expected loss, which you should set to an amount that could
  never realistically be reached. I think this is incorrect.

  By instead setting the max expected loss to the median loss streak (3 or 4) a
  few things will happen:
  * Long win streaks will be far more profitable
  * Most losses will be redeemed by wins
  * The loss streaks that exceed the max expected loss will just be in the same
    scenario as if the stakes were the same and maximized for each round.
    However, they will be less costly than equal stake rounds because you'll be
    building up to the max loss.
  * Since every round is seeking to reclaim the total deficit, the first
    redemptive win after the loss that exceeded the max expected loss, can be
    succceeded by wins to reclaim the total loss.

* I think the final max expected loss will be 3 or 4 and this should bring
  daily returns to a consistent 1-2%.

* Interesting day. AMZN won after 6 rounds, MSFT after 7.
* However as predicted, most of the other assets slowly increased their losses
  throughout the rest of the day as the price started to consolidate.
* Near the day's end, I decided to try re-implementing martingale. I've noticed
  over the last couple of weeks that the average win rate has been 40 - 60%
  with few if any loss streaks exceeding 6. Maybe I have reached a point
  runaway martingale losses are unlikely.

  well-sized deficit.

* I started by setting the exit threhsold to 30x the long-term one-second
  variance.
* This failed because the fast movement triggered many losses.
* I changed exit threshold to be the greater of the two one-sec variances.
* It was actually doing decently:
  * TSLA had reached its 1% return within a couple of hours.
  * The other assets, however, were mostly stuck in consolidation.
* However, shortly after 1pm CT, all assets prices started a sharp decline that
  lasted the rest of the day.
* This led to long win streaks across the board:
  * AAPL (13); AMZN (7); MSFT (5); QQQ (10); SPY (11)
* It's important to acknowledge that this is a rare circumstance. It is good to
  know, however, that in this scenario the algorithm makes the most money.
* What should happen more often is that if assets win, it will be within the
  first 1-2 hours.
* After that, they'll mostly lose during consolidation.

### 2022-06-08:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* I tried going for 3% return.
* AMZN and TSLA almost made it, but didn't quite hit the mark.
* There were one or two that were also positive, but after the morning, most
  prices consolidated much of the rest of the day and resulted in losses.
* I'm going to go back to targeting 2% with an exit threshold of 30x the
  long-term 1-sec variance.

### 2022-06-07:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* AMZN: -750.99 after 02:47:14 of run time
* Switched to using long-term 3-minute one-sec variance. AMZN ended at -$63.36
  with a win rate of 48.48%
* 4/6 won today: AAPL, MSFT, QQQ, and SPY. That's very good
* 2/6 lost, AMZN lost ~$800. I think this is because the exit threshold shrank
  too much over time.
* In response, I'm going to use the long-term one-second variance taken over
  10K samples.
* This way, a profitable mid day can compensate for a losing morning
* I'm also increasing the target profit to 3% so the big winners can more
  greatly compensate for the losers.

##### Stocks/ETFs
* Today was the first day I implemented a daily target profit and trailing
  stop.
* 3 / 5 won: MSFT, QQQ, TSLA (twice)
* SPY almost won, AAPL's max profit was $0.62
* The idea is to continue doing this and observe:
  * What's the daily win rate across all assets?
  * Are there some that seem to consistently perform well? So far, TSLA is the
    top contender.

### 2022-06-02:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Interesting day
* The day started off very down, but then picked up by mid morning.
* By the near end of the day QQQ and TSLA were winning with win rates greater
  than 50%. AAPL and SPY's deficits overshadowed their siblings profits.
* The day started with consolidation at almost the exact height of the
  thresholdds.
* Since the prices movements slow throughout the day, it was hard for late day
  gains to overcome an early deficit.
* THEN at around 2:30pm CT, the stream just stopped receiving messages. It
  didn't error out, it was just non-responsive.
* This brought everyone's price movement to 0 and kicked off a flurry of
  immediate closures which tanked the day's gains.
* This made it apparent that I'll need to build a stream status check for
  `get_quote` to fall back to the historical quote endpoint if the streamed
  quote is stale.

#### Next Thing(s) to Try

### 2022-06-01:
#### Remarks
##### Stocks/ETFs
* Interesting day today.
* I started by observing the short tern one second net average and determing a
  threshold that might be a good entry indicator.
* Meanwhile TaoBot was following trends with an exit threshold of 20x one
  second variance. This ended at a loss after about 2 hours.
* Also, red4 was red-lining and I think this was intermittently interrupting
  the quote stream, so I moved everything to the desktop.
* When I implemented the one second net average threshold, it failed miserably.
* This led me to the following thought:
  * If I were to set the exit threshold at a ridiculously high amount, such
    that it would only execute one trade in the whole day, the stocks who
    happened to guess right would be the only ones to win. However, the right
    guessers would be guaranteed to win by the amount the price profited since
    the day's open.
  * If, however, I set the threshold too low, there will be many more trades,
    but there will be many losses because of temporary or sharp corrections.
  * The more trades there are, the more likely losses will dominate.
  * The goal should be to find the perfect threshold that will allows you to
    trade often enough to profit on put bear and bull trends, but not often
    enough that you're getting destroyed by fluctuations.
* I ended the day by trying 40x the one-second variance. This ended ~+$70 after
  about 2 hours of play.
* I'll observe this tomorrow on the desktop and increase the threshold if I
  think it's still too susceptible to corrections.

    otherwise switch directions.

* Big bummer today 😞 I accidentally started the app in production. Since it
  had succeeded in staging for the last five days, I figured it wouldn't be
  unreasonable to test it in production. Here were the results:

Wins: 89 (44.28%) • Losses: 112 • Total: 201

```

* The day started at a near 5% loss then rebounded to its peak, which was again
  at around 9:30am, then lost for much of the rest of the day.
* A few thing seem apparent:
  1. Maybe I do need to implement a premature close algorithm -- I haven't seen
     an single day in the last week that has ended at its peak.
    * I can at least do this and push to production until I can figure out a
      way to make money throughout the whole day.
  2. I probably need to spread the risk across multiple securities -- I suppose
     it's possible that there's some fundamental disadvantage in production
     that staging obscures. However, I think it's more likely that either the
     retarded near-win polling interval was excessively increased, or that a
     low win percentage is simply possible.
     * By spreading the risk across multiple securities, you'll reduce the
       chances of one blowout loss undoing a whole day's gains for its
       siblings.

* Today's performance makes me want to abandon trying to come up with a
  premature exit strategy.
* First, it appears that the slower polling near wins is in fact weighting wins
  since a win rate <50% still results in a profit.
* I'm still astounded by how close to 50% the win rate is over time when using
  pure random as an entry indicator.. I still don't quite understand why, but
  this is the fifth day in a row.
* A few things seem apparent:
  1. The more plays the greater the return.
    * This suggests that an asset with fast moving price will generate more
      return over the long run.
    * This is also a good sign for Forex which would run indefinitely.
    * Maybe it also means that the risk should be spread across many
      securities.
  2. It still closed at a fraction of the peak.
    * Still not sure if this means a reasonable premature exit needs to be
      engineered.
    * If it is, maybe it's:
      If you've played more than 100 rounds and your win rate is > 50.0%?
    * The peaks were at 9:30am (again), 10am, and 10:30am.
    * Not sure if this is a coincidence.
  3. Weighting the wins seems to be working -- There's a higher return for
     lower win rates. We'll see how it performs tomorrow.

* The day started off with a 25% win rate in the first half hour.
* By 9:30am it had mostly recovered its losses.
* It then spent most of the day with a < 50% win rate until 2:20pm when it hit
  its peak. Its win rate at this time was ~52%.
* It then hit a couple loss streaks and ended at 47.86%, BUT it still profited
  0.01%.
* Slowing down the polling interval for near wins and accelerating it for near
  losses seems to have favorable weighted wins to the point that a less than
  50% win rate still resulted in a modest profit.
* The day's win rate was to be expected if other days' win rates were >50%.
* A few questions to answer:
  * What about days when the win rate is closer to 40%?
  * Is it possible to time a cash out point?
  * What would be the effect of alternating direction on each trade to achieve
    a true 1:1 ratio of buys and sells?
  * Would it be better to pick a stock like TSLA with more price action?
* If this strategy will almost always result in near 50% win rate, maybe it
  makes sense to construct an early termination algorithm that says something
  like the following:
  * If the max win rate has exceeded 60%,
  * and the return has exceeded 2.0%,
  * and the current return has lost 20% of its peak value,
  * then you should stop trading for the day.
* For that to make sense, I would have to never see a trading day end at its
  peak return.
* I have seen this, but it is far more rare than early / mid-day peaks.

  that it still profited though it wouldn't have lasted too many more losses.

* Two wins in a row, which is great.

* This was with only 2x margin
* I think the reason why this worked much better than last time is that the
  stop profit and stop loss thresholds are roughly the same, and stop profit
  being flexible gives wins a bit more weight.
* I'll try this again on Monday with a WebSockets client streaming the quote
  prices. I'm still seeing positions exit or enter too late because of the
  laggy quote endpoint. Hopefully this will help improve performance.

* Very interesting day.
* I started by trying to increase the entry wait time upon each consecutive
  loss as an attempt to combat consolidation reversals.
* This didn't work and lost ~$1K.
* Then I reverted the entry wait time to 30 seconds.
* Then tried to enter in the signal position's opposite on every odd-numbered
  loss. That didn't work.
* Then I tried contradicting the entry signal after two consecutive losses.
  This seemed to work. These were the results after 04:44:57 of runtime:

  ```
* Note that 3 consecutive losses were averted TEN times. That's really significant.
* We'll see if this is the consolidation counter-measure that I've been seeking.
* I also increased the min max-loss ratio to 0.09% to allow more time to win.
* 🚨 **ALERT** Under NO circumstances should you run production until you can
  get to $30K in staging. 🚨
* There were a few too many fetch quote lags, some may have cost wins again.
  It's possible that the quote endpoint isn't meant to be used as a realtime
  stream. WebSockets is still the way to go.
