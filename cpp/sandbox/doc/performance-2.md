###### Stats (PRODUCTION) (as of 2023-03-08)
* Win Record: 15W (48.39%) 16L (Total 31)

###### Notes
* Another somewhat frustrating day where I goofed at the beginning. TSLA's log
  was hanging and I didn't realize it was silenced so I restarted its instance.
* It put TSLA in a position where it incurred one more loss than it needed to.
* The good news is that both production and staging recovered from massive
  deficits further demonstrating the current strategy's profitability.
* Keep the faith, keep your money in, and don't switch strategies.
* Very fascinating that that the +6.25%/-2.5% strategy is now outpacing the
  pure 2.5:1 strategy. I should keep watching and perhaps run that strategy
  in Beta.

###### Stats (PRODUCTION) (as of 2023-03-08)
* Win Record: 16W (51.61%) 15L (Total 31)

###### Notes
* I had a _very_ frustrating day 😡.
* I was nervous about crashing out at $25K so I changed production's strategy
  to another profitable backtested strategy that closed trading after -2.5%
  loss.
* Production hit the loss threshold. Not only staging not hit this threshold,
  but it went on to win +8.31%, peaking at ~+10%.
* Even though production ended at a slight profit, it almost certainly would
  have also earned a large win.
* Staging is profitable; the most profitable it's ever been. Backtesting
  demonstrates that the current strategy is the most profitable approach.
* I missed out on a big win because I second-guessed my strategy with another
  one.
* Furthermore, this strategy is profitable _because_ it earns massive wins that
  supercede large losses. If you miss large wins, then it takes longer to see
  long-term profits.
* As evidence of this, staging is at its peak balance and is sitting at a +50%
  return in two months. That's _really_ good.
* Conclusion: Both backtestingg and staging demonstrate this strategy's
  profitability. Stop changing things in production and let it run its course.
* This may mean that you need to increase the balance to $30K to create a
  comfortable distance between production's balance and the $25K minimum.

* This finding is very interesting espcially given that the 1.5:1 and 2.0:1
  ratios have typically performed very poorly.
* It seems like we can discount the median `max_profit` as a `stop_profit`
  target. Backtests indicate that low stop-profit-to-stop-loss ratios lead to
  large losses. I can, however, try it to be certain.
* Backtests demonstrate that:
  * The mean and median `max_profit`s are not profitable stop profits. They're
    too small.
  * The mean stop profit worked okay, but only when the `stop_loss` was 62.5x.
    This makes sense since the average `max_profit` was pegged to a `stop_loss`
    62.5.
  * 2.5:1 and 2.75:1 are the highest perfomring `stop_profit` ratios. Now it's
    time to see which `stop_loss`es work with the highest performing
    `stop_profit`s

###### Next Thing(s) to Try
* Backtests to Run:
  * Mean and Median Max Profits as Stop Profits
  * All Stop Profit Ratios Vs. Differing Stop Losses (15, 20, 25, 30, 35)

###### Notes
* Backtesting continues present 2.5:1 as the highest winner.
* Next steps are to investigate why this may be by seeing if the target profits
  are in any way related to `backtest_no_stop_profit` medians, means, etc.
* It would also be interesting to measure 2.5:1's performance at different stop

###### Stats (PRODUCTION) (as of 2023-03-08)

###### Stats (PRODUCTION) (All Time)
* Wins / Losses: 46W (51.69%) (Consecutive: 0) 43L (Consecutive: 1)
* Latest Return: -$1,720.14 (-6.04%) (-298.16% 9-5 Salary) (vs. NASDAQ: -0.21%) (vs. S&P 500: -0.21%)
* Week's Return: +$66.37 • Total Return: -$9,834.70
* Average Return: -0.36% • Average NASDAQ Return: +0.04% • Average S&P 500 Return: +0.04%

###### Notes
* The prior backtests can't fully be trusted because they had some bugs that
  precluded idempotence. I fixed those and got a more honest account of each
  strategy's performance.
* I need to double check their idempotence.
* The good news is that TaoBot is profitable with two stop-profit-to-stop-loss
  ratios: 2.5:1 and 2.75:1
* 2.5:1 had the highest finish and max. This is fittiingly the ratio that I've
  been using.
* I still need to understand why this is and how subject to change it is.
* Other interesting findings
  * The `No Stop Profit` strategy ended up at basically break even
  * The smaller ratios < 2.25 resulted in large losses. This is consistent with
    my historical findings.
* After correcting bugs and running a second backtest, the tests appear to be
  idempotent. I'll continue to run them and assess their findings.

###### Stats (PRODUCTION) (as of 2023-03-08)
* Win Record: 13W (52.0%) 12L (Total 25)

###### Notes
* Nice win in production 🙌
* I suspect the backtest hangs are from db queries that inexplicably stall. I'm
  adding a `statement_timeout` of 1 second to help avoid this if it is indeed
  the problem.
* After two successful full backtest runs there were no more hangs so that's
  good 🎈
* The backtest runs, however, are not idempotent 😬
* Tomorrow I'll investigate why this may be, but the silver lining is that
  their relative performance was consistent across both runs: 2.0:1, 2.25:1,
  and 2.5:1 consistently had the highest returns. This is great!
* For now, I'll keep the 2.5:1 ratio for live trading. When I achieve backtest
  idempotence, I'll adjust (if necessary) to the most profitable
  stop-profit-to-stop-loss ratio.
* Great job so far though! This thing is really coming together 😊

###### Notes
* As anticipated, changing nothing between yesterday's big loss and today was
  the correct thing to do.
* In the past I would have eiher changed the algorithm or abstained from
  trading today out of fear.
* The week could still close at a loss, but for now, I've bought some time.
* More importantly...I FINISHED BUILDING BACKTESTING!! 🎉🎈🎊🥳
* Now I have to run several different strategies and observe their performance
  to tell whether TaoBot's current iteration is theoretically / historically
  profitable.
* I can only start as soon at 3/27, but it's better than nothing!
* Potential problem with backtesting. It looks like the margin buying power
  keeps getting updated instead of staying at the original margin buying for
  the day. Buuut, I think that's just in the log. Double check that the actual
  quantity computations are using the right values.
* WOW! After the first round of comparative backtesting, the 2.5:1 ratio is the
  winner! 🥳
* This should come as no surprise as it has performed the best in the past
  several weeks.
* The more surprising finding is that all approaches were profitable, even if
  only mildly.
* The most profitable ratios are 2.5:1 and 2.75:1. I'll keep experimenting and
  analyzing the data to learn why this may be and if I can further optimize,
  but great job building this!
* WAIT!! None of the backtests finished!! 😱 They all stalled. Maybe this is
  because I was running them concurrently?
* I guess I'll have to try again and run them one-by-one 😬

* Wow! This was the worst recorded for both production and staging.
* Staging is still profiting, so I'm not necessarily dissuaded about the the
  strategy's overal profitability.
* I also anticipated that this could / would happen. In the past, I would close
  down production or change its strategy only to find that staging / the prior
  strategy profits the following day.
* I'll only shut down production if I can demonstrate in backtesting that the
  strategy is in fact unprofitable in the long run.

###### Stats (PRODUCTION) (as of 2023-03-08)
* Win Record: 11W (50.0%) 11L (Total 22)

###### Notes
* Today was Production's highest return (I think), at least with the current
  iteration of TaoBot.
* Staging had another very large return and...for the first time ever...IT
  BROKE $40K!!! 🎉🥳 🎈
* This is a really major landmark for staging and is when I would have gone
  live if I hadn't been already running live, concurrently for the last couple
  of weeks.
* Hitting this threshold increases my confidence in the current TaoBot
  iteration and affirms its three major components:
  1. STAY IN -- Don't close at predetermined account profit / loss levels. You
     need mega wins to overcome mega losses and the only way to do that is by
     staying in, even after a sizeable gain.

     The only way this is profitable, however, is if you avoid catastrophic loss
     days (<-6%). This seems to only be achieveable by having stop profit
     threshold. This brings me to my second point.

  2. TAKE PROFIT -- You have to take intraday profits in order to take
     advantage large intraday (reversing) trends. Being able to capture on
     these treds introduces the possibility of capturing very large profits.

     The question this presents is, "At what point should you take your
     profit?" with a follow up of, "How does it compare to my stop loss?". See
     the final point.

  3. YOU WILL BOTH INEVITABLY WIN _AND_ LOSE -- You can count on losing at
     least one position just about every day, but you can also almost always
     count on winning at least one position every day. Anothing I discovered is
     that **if your single loss magnitude outweighs your single win magnitude,
     you will almost certainly lose money**.

     My theory, however, is that the inverse must also be true: if your single
     win magnitude outweighs your single loss magnitude, you should win over
     time. If, however, your take profit is too high, you'll rarely reach it
     and it's effectively the same as not taking any profit.

* The final piece of this puzzle has been determining what the take profit
  threshold should be. More specifically, what should its ratio to the current
  stop loss be? A `stop_profit` that is too small, doesn't take full advantage
  of large trends and is easily overcome by lossess. A `stop_profit` that's too
  large will never be reached. The ratio that I've found most successful over
  the last month has been a 2.5:1 stop-profit-to-stop-loss ratio.

* I want to confirm this with backtesting and see if perhaps another ratio is
  more profitable. Does this ratio change over time? If so, is it computable?
* All these will be uncovered over the next couple of weeks.

###### Notes
* Okay, the 2.5:1 strategy was outperforming the Avg Max Profit strategy so I
  reverted after 30 min in production.
* Production ended up winning as a result.
* Smaller take profits do poorly during long trending periods and may do well
  in consolidation, but it's not definitive.
* This is all the more reason to keep building backtesting. It will give me
  more confidence in each iteration I draft.
* In even better news, staging is at its higher balance ever 🎉 and it still
  hasn't sustained a loss greater than ~-6% since 3/10. Since the 2.5:1 ratio,
  it has suffered a couple of ~-6% losses, but it has overall profited.
* Demonstrate this in backtesting and see if that ratio can be computed, in
  case it changes.

* Morning started with bad consolidation from AMZN.
* However it kept reaching the historical average max profit before losing.
* I then changed the stop profit thresholds for production to use this
  historical average and performance improved.
* I'm using the historical average from staging and will leave its stop profit
  as a 2.5:1 ratio to its stop loss so that it can continue producing a
  reliable average for production.
* Eventually I'll want to use backtesting to generate this average.
* This is yet another day on which it would have been a bad idea to terminate a

* Win Record: 7W (50.00%) 7L (Total 14)

###### Notes
* Okay here's an important conclusion: You can't close because of morning loss.
* Many mornings will start with consolidation, so you can't count on a lucky
  streak of trend mornings to generate overall profit.
* You have to compute the right take-profit-to-stop-loss ratio that will
  consistently yield profitable returns or otherwise non-catastrophic losses.
* The 2.5:1 ratio has done a good job of avoiding such losses and has in fact
  led to some major returns.
* I'll restart production tomorrow and run it side by side with staging.

* Win Record: 7W (50.00%) 7L (Total 14)

###### Notes
* Okay so the luck is officially over. It's good to be break even though.
* The problem with the current strategy is that it still depends on heavy early
  morning trending.
* As I've seen, this may or may not happen, and is sometimes entirely dependent
  on a lucky first guess.
* So? What should I do?
* Obviously keep building backtesting so I can move forward with greater
  confidence in a specific strategy.
* What I need to decide now is whether I should go back to only staging until
  staging gets to $40K or crashes out.

###### Notes
* The change to a 2.5:1 take-profit-to-stop-loss ratio was actually the exact
  amount needed for today.
* If I had kept it at 3:1, I'm fairly certain today would have lost.
* A 2.5:1 ratio would have almost certainly resulted in a win yesterday as
  well. So I'll keep it here for now.
* Look at staging's return 😳
* I've never seen that before.
* It was directly because of the 2.5:1 ratio change. Is it possible that this
  is the true golden ratio? 🧐. We'll see.
* If it is, is there a way to compute this ratio, in case it changes over time?
* In the last week, staging has more often profited than lost after closing
  production. This may suggest that I do in fact need to let the algorithm run
  all day.
* I'll only make this change if staging can get to a balance $40K.

* Okay, it looks like the eerie high win rate is over.
* Now we have to see if this strategy loses more often than it wins, and if the
  account balance can survive until the next win streak.
* I'm strongly considering reducing the take-profit-stop-loss ratio from 3:1 to
  2.5:1. TaoBot would have won today if that were the case and it missed
  successive wins as a result.

###### Notes
* I almost lost the win in the second session when TSLA took on an immediate
  loss. It seems reasonable to expect that one day will lose while chasing a >=
  +3% return. The risk justification will depend on how much money is saved by
  reopening sub-three-percent first sessions.
* 3x the stop loss threshold has been a good win target for TSLA, however, it
  seems to be a bit much for AMZN.
* This suggests that win targets should be determined on a per-symbol basis.
* This will be one of the first things I finish building back testing.

###### Notes
* Okay. The win rate is regressing closer to what I'd expect
* I had to manually close production today because the API's /account endpoint
  was hanging and triggered the "Unusual Account Balance Delta" error.
* I increase the threshold to 10%, so it should be much less likely to happen.
* The week still ended profitably, but we'll see how next week goes.

* Weird situation in staging where the price movements got jacked up because of
  parsed quote timestamps that seemed to be coming from far in the future that
  Alpaca was returning.
* I reverted to using the current epoch and everything seems to be okay now.

###### Notes
* The luck had to run out eventually 😂
* I stopped loss after production failed and switched to staging. It's very
  possible that staying in would have led to a win, given staging's peak.
  However, so far it's very down and could have resulted in a big loss
  for production.
* Staging almost hit the target but then got stuck in consolidation.
* I restarted to test a smaller stop profit for just staging.
* Phew! Good thing I stayed out of staging. It suffered a heavy loss, even
  after switching to a smaller stop loss.
* TSLA ran up a 14-loss streak. Even though the session peaked at a +2% profit,
  it ended up losing. What's unclear, however, is whether this would have
  happened during high volatility. I've been here enough times though, that I'm
  just going to revert to the larger stop loss.

* Win Record: 1W (100.0%) 0L (Total 1)

###### Notes
* The last 7/7 days have hit the +3% target, including today, the first day in
  production.
* I'm still apprehensive because I haven't had a series of consolidation
  mornings. Most mornings have had heavy trending.
* I still feel like there will be an upcoming streak of losses as usually
  happens. We'll see.

###### Notes
* Interesting! That's 6/6 (7/7) where the 3% target has been hit.
* I feel like I've been here before though. I'll turn it on in production and
  it'll then crap out 😭
* Seems like the options are:
  1. Keep gathering data and go live next week
  2. Just go live now and risk the loss
  3. Go live and immediately add more funds if it craps out
  4. Go live and reduce margin buying power
* I think I'm just going to do Option #2

  It's actually 6/6 days if you consider the fact that last Monday's reset was
  trading at only 2x margin buying power.
* There was heavy trending again today, so I need to see what happens on true
  consolidation days.

  ratio strategy.
* I'll watch for another full week before closing the day when it hits the
  target.
* No days had crazy losses which is interesting.
* Most days had decent early morning trending so I'll have to see how it
  performs during a stretch of early morning consolidation.

  did after having missed the first 45 min.
* Keep watching and keep building back testing.

* Win Record: 1W (33.33%) 2L (Total 3)

###### Notes
* Things were going great for the first couple of hours.
* Then I woke up from a nap and saw that there were premature order closures
  that undid all of the morning's profits.
* The premature closures were caused by a bug in TaoBot reading price movement
  data from Quote. Sometimes Quote failed to parse the JSON file and returned
  empty price movement data.
* I resumed trading after fixing the bug, and it did okay.
* It was good to see the take profit strategy work at 3x stop loss. I'll keep
  this as the threshold for now as I continue to build back testing.

* The 3:1 profit-to-loss ratio strategy modestly won, closing well below its
  peak.
* It's important to note that if I had done a permanent hold of profitable
  positions, I would have lost today.
* TSLA did stop just $0.04 shy of hitting the target for a second win which
  makes me think I whould reduce the win's target to perhaps 2.5.
* However, perhaps I should also just keep it and maybe watch for another day.
* This is again why I need back testing.

* Win Record: 0W (0.0%) 1L (Total 1)

###### Notes
* I tried capturing a profit of +0.5% while risking -1.5% loss in the first 45
  minutes.
* As expected it lost heavily. Each round would only win if TSLA happened to be
  right. I've seen this before.
* After reseting, I switched to a 3:1 profit-risk ratio strategy for the rest
  of the day.
* It had a high peak early in the day, but ultimately lost to consolidation.
* I also stopped closing sessions, for wins and losses, and will just observe
  this strategy's performance as I continue to build back testing.
* The only thing I may adjust is the profit-to-loss ratio by reducing it from
  3.

* Win Record
  * Total: 8W (%57.14) 6L (Total 14)
    * First Round Wins: 6Y (%85.71) 2N (Total 8)
  * Hit Target in 1st Round: 6Y (%42.86) 8N (Total 14)
  * Hit Target in Whole Day: 7Y (%50.0) 7N (Total 14)
  * Post-win re-rentry record: 3W (42.86%) 4L (Total: 7)
    * 2 big wins, 1 big loss
* Estimated Returns By Strategy:
  * 1st Win Exit; 1st Loss Exit: -9.29%
  * 1st Win Exit; Re-enter Until Win: -8.79%
    * Surprised how close this was to closing after each loss.
  * Re-enter All Day: -23.08%
    * Definitely NOT the way to go 😬
  * Take 0.5%, Risk -2%: -0.57%
    * Win Rate: 11W (78.57%) 3L
  * Take 0.5%, Risk -1.5%: +0.96% ❗❗

###### Notes
* Okay! After three weeks, it seems safe to say that this strategy, the
  hold-profit momentum strategy is not profitable. Though it has an overall
  winning record, its losses are too great to return a profit.
* What's worse is that the only hope this had of being profitable was to
  re-enter upon first round loss. The loss would have been greater if you
  stopped trading after the first round.
* It's actually consistent with my theory: If your potential loss amount is
  greater than your target win, you will always lose money.
* One of strategies -- Target +0.5%, Risk -1.5% -- seems to potentially be
  mildly profitable across 14 samples.
* I'm curious if we can get a daily profit from that. I'll try it as I continue
  to build back testing.

###### Notes
* Wow! Okay so we we have our second day in which the win happened later in the
  day. This gives stronger evidence to the necessity of re-entry upon early
  loss.
* It was also the first day that won, but didn't hit the target.
* Very interesting. I'll watch staging tomorrow, compute the overall return and
  make a decision for production on Monday.
