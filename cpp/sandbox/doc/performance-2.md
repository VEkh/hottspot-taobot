###### Stats (PRODUCTION) (as of 2023-03-08)
* Win Record: 6W (66.67%) 3L (Total 9)

###### Notes
* I almost lost the win in the second session when TSLA took on an immediate
  loss. It seems reasonable to expect that one day will lose while chasing a >=
  +3% return. The risk justification will depend on how much money is saved by
  reopening sub-three-percent first sessions.
* 3x the stop loss threshold has been a good win target for TSLA, however, it
  seems to be a bit much for AMZN.
* This suggests that win targets should be determined on a per-symbol basis.
* This will be one of the first things I finish building back testing.

###### Notes
* Okay. The win rate is regressing closer to what I'd expect
* I had to manually close production today because the API's /account endpoint
  was hanging and triggered the "Unusual Account Balance Delta" error.
* I increase the threshold to 10%, so it should be much less likely to happen.
* The week still ended profitably, but we'll see how next week goes.

* Weird situation in staging where the price movements got jacked up because of
  parsed quote timestamps that seemed to be coming from far in the future that
  Alpaca was returning.
* I reverted to using the current epoch and everything seems to be okay now.

###### Notes
* The luck had to run out eventually 😂
* I stopped loss after production failed and switched to staging. It's very
  possible that staying in would have led to a win, given staging's peak.
  However, so far it's very down and could have resulted in a big loss
  for production.
* Staging almost hit the target but then got stuck in consolidation.
* I restarted to test a smaller stop profit for just staging.
* Phew! Good thing I stayed out of staging. It suffered a heavy loss, even
  after switching to a smaller stop loss.
* TSLA ran up a 14-loss streak. Even though the session peaked at a +2% profit,
  it ended up losing. What's unclear, however, is whether this would have
  happened during high volatility. I've been here enough times though, that I'm
  just going to revert to the larger stop loss.

  happens. We'll see.

* Interesting! That's 6/6 (7/7) where the 3% target has been hit.
* I feel like I've been here before though. I'll turn it on in production and
  it'll then crap out 😭
* Seems like the options are:
  1. Keep gathering data and go live next week
  2. Just go live now and risk the loss
  3. Go live and immediately add more funds if it craps out
  4. Go live and reduce margin buying power
* I think I'm just going to do Option #2

  It's actually 6/6 days if you consider the fact that last Monday's reset was
  trading at only 2x margin buying power.
* There was heavy trending again today, so I need to see what happens on true
  consolidation days.

* I'll watch for another full week before closing the day when it hits the

* No days had crazy losses which is interesting.
* Most days had decent early morning trending so I'll have to see how it
  performs during a stretch of early morning consolidation.

  did after having missed the first 45 min.
* Keep watching and keep building back testing.

* Win Record: 1W (33.33%) 2L (Total 3)

###### Notes
* Things were going great for the first couple of hours.
* Then I woke up from a nap and saw that there were premature order closures
  that undid all of the morning's profits.
* The premature closures were caused by a bug in TaoBot reading price movement
  data from Quote. Sometimes Quote failed to parse the JSON file and returned
  empty price movement data.
* I resumed trading after fixing the bug, and it did okay.
* It was good to see the take profit strategy work at 3x stop loss. I'll keep
  this as the threshold for now as I continue to build back testing.

###### Notes
* The 3:1 profit-to-loss ratio strategy modestly won, closing well below its
  peak.
* It's important to note that if I had done a permanent hold of profitable
  positions, I would have lost today.
* TSLA did stop just $0.04 shy of hitting the target for a second win which
  makes me think I whould reduce the win's target to perhaps 2.5.
* However, perhaps I should also just keep it and maybe watch for another day.
* This is again why I need back testing.

###### Stats (STAGING) (as of 2023-02-27)
* Win Record: 0W (0.0%) 1L (Total 1)

###### Notes
* I tried capturing a profit of +0.5% while risking -1.5% loss in the first 45
  minutes.
* As expected it lost heavily. Each round would only win if TSLA happened to be
  right. I've seen this before.
* After reseting, I switched to a 3:1 profit-risk ratio strategy for the rest
  of the day.
* It had a high peak early in the day, but ultimately lost to consolidation.
* I also stopped closing sessions, for wins and losses, and will just observe
  this strategy's performance as I continue to build back testing.
* The only thing I may adjust is the profit-to-loss ratio by reducing it from
  3.

  * Total: 8W (%57.14) 6L (Total 14)
    * First Round Wins: 6Y (%85.71) 2N (Total 8)
  * Hit Target in 1st Round: 6Y (%42.86) 8N (Total 14)
  * Hit Target in Whole Day: 7Y (%50.0) 7N (Total 14)
  * Post-win re-rentry record: 3W (42.86%) 4L (Total: 7)
    * 2 big wins, 1 big loss
* Estimated Returns By Strategy:
  * 1st Win Exit; 1st Loss Exit: -9.29%
  * 1st Win Exit; Re-enter Until Win: -8.79%
    * Surprised how close this was to closing after each loss.
  * Re-enter All Day: -23.08%
    * Definitely NOT the way to go 😬
  * Take 0.5%, Risk -2%: -0.57%
    * Win Rate: 11W (78.57%) 3L
  * Take 0.5%, Risk -1.5%: +0.96% ❗❗

###### Notes
* Okay! After three weeks, it seems safe to say that this strategy, the
  hold-profit momentum strategy is not profitable. Though it has an overall
  winning record, its losses are too great to return a profit.
* What's worse is that the only hope this had of being profitable was to
  re-enter upon first round loss. The loss would have been greater if you
  stopped trading after the first round.
* It's actually consistent with my theory: If your potential loss amount is
  greater than your target win, you will always lose money.
* One of strategies -- Target +0.5%, Risk -1.5% -- seems to potentially be
  mildly profitable across 14 samples.
* I'm curious if we can get a daily profit from that. I'll try it as I continue
  to build back testing.

###### Notes
* Wow! Okay so we we have our second day in which the win happened later in the
  day. This gives stronger evidence to the necessity of re-entry upon early
  loss.
* It was also the first day that won, but didn't hit the target.
* Very interesting. I'll watch staging tomorrow, compute the overall return and
  make a decision for production on Monday.
