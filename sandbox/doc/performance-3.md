###### Stats (PRODUCTION) (All Time)
* Wins / Losses: 131W (53.25%) (Consecutive: 0) 115L (Consecutive: 1)
* Latest Return: -$1281.94 (-2.11%) (-222.20% 9-5 Salary) (vs. NASDAQ: +0.30%) (vs. S&P 500: +0.53%)
* Week's Return: -$970.65 • Total Return: -$11277.38
* Average Return: -0.11% • Average NASDAQ Return: +0.09% • Average S&P 500 Return: +0.06%

###### Notes
* ⚡ I've FINALLY confirmed a strategy that guarantees the return I've been
  seeking: Simple momentum in which the most recent winning position is held
  until day's end.
* After 6.5 months of running in backtesting, its return was 281.18%. See
  20131203-backtest-momentum-60 to confirm.
* It's average daily return is +0.9%
* This is good and what will run in production.
* I'll continue to seek a strategy that earns +1.0-2.0%, and one that
  guarantees a daily return. It will be good, however, to have something that
  will guarantee a profit.

###### Notes
* It's time to change Live Alpha to flat 2.0:-2.0. It's performend too poorly
  over the last two weeks.
* Maybe it will have an amazing comeback in the next few weeks, bue even from a
  client perspective, I wouldn't want to have to report such large weekly
  losses.
* Live Alpha and Live Beta are now running the same strategy and should be
  profitable by both backtesting and Paper Gamma performance.
* I'm working now on using inverse perdictions as a way to ride trends to
  completion. It's showing promise in backtesting, but can also lead to major
  losses. I'd love to get a strategy that works every day.

###### Notes
* Today was the first day that I introduced a flat +2.0/-2.0 account profit /
  loss strategy. It's been the most consistently profitable in all of
  backtesting.
* I'll run backtesting with a +6.25/-2.5 to confirm when and whether it was a
  profitable strategy and if it still can be.

###### Notes
* I've noticed that ML-3 tends to do best in the morning then poorly throughout
  the day.
* I also had the idea to scale the momentum stop loss threshold by the current
  volatility.
* This seemed to improve the performance of momentum. I'll run a backtest to
  verify this.
* Since momentum can get destroyed during a large consolidation morning, but do
  better throughout the day, and ML-3 does best during a high consolidation
  morning but poorly throughout the day, I'm going to try and use each strategy
  when they're most advantageous: ML-3 during high volatility (most mornings)
  and Momentum during low volatility.
* At first glance this works very well. I'll run backtesting all night and see
  what the results are.

###### Notes
* I ran backtesting on the 3-min predictions in the `all` prediction scope.
* Though the performance hasn't been horrible, I'm noticing, that it really
  only guesses buy for AMZN and sell for TSLA.
* Even if this happens to be correct, depending on the day, it's not a properly
  trained model.
* After running backtest with an ML, duration minutes 5 strategy, it seems
  apparent that duration minutes 3 performs slightly better.
* This lower performance is despite higher prediction accuracy.
* The brightest news is that `backtest-momentum` closed at a profit when I
  changed the `stop_profit_ratio` from 2.5 to 2. I'll make this change in
  production and see if it has any impact.

###### Stats (PRODUCTION) (as of 2023-07-18)
* Win Record: 4W (36.36%) 7L (Total 11)
* Better Performer: Live Alpha: 5 • Paper Beta: 6 (Total: 10)

###### Notes
* I now know what I need to do.
* This weekend was a good weekend of backtesting. It reavealed a few things:
  1. Backtesting is actually a decently reliable litmus test for performance.
  2. Profit-biased momentum outperforms all machine learning approaches. +5.00%
     Is perhaps a better target than +6.25% because it was more often attained.
  3. All the consolidation, opposing predictions, etc. algorthims were me
     trying to outsmart the trained models. Doing so didn't yield better
     performance than pure momentum.
  4. When, however, I made changes that only and always listened to predictions
     whenever new ones are made, I observed that catastrophic (< -8.00%) losses
     were almost entirely avoided. This is because the model predicts at a
     40-50% accuracy virtually every day. Despite this, almost every day ended
     in a loss. This made me realize that I should be focusing instead on two
     things:
    1. The stop loss threshold is too large. Wins are unable to balance out
        losses despite a near 50/50 win rate. I need to tweak the stop loss
        threshold to get results closer to break even.
    2. Beyond this, I should only focus on increasing the accuracy of the
       models. This will give me a higher possibility of reaching the holy
       grail, which is a strategy that makes money over time no matter when it
       is started.
* Until I resolve 4.1 and 4.2, I'll revert production to win-biased momentum
  and reduce the target profit from +6.25% to +5.00%.
* Model performance
* I ran a backtest run for duration 3 minutes and for the first time only saw a
  max equity of < +%1 five times. That's a really big deal!

###### Next Thing(s) to Try
* Run predictions only backtest need to run with using all models instead of
  the highest performing one for each symbol.
* Check to see if there's a time after which the prediction success rate is
  near 50%.

###### Notes
* I introduced the hold trend strategy today. It actually saved paper alpha
  from a big loss! Maybe I need to give it more time.
* Single-scope training with shuffled training set seems to yield a similar
  behavior to non-shuffled training.
* 🌟 Single-scope training, three models, inputs not shuffled, with trend holding
  far outperformed the other strategies (see
  `doc/backtest_runs/20231012-backtest-ml-5-single-hold_trend.txt`)
* I'll backtest this through other low performing time periods and note
  performance.
* With ML predictions, I can so far profit during:
  * Sideways conslidation, prediction right 🎉
  * Trending, prediction right
* The last situation I need to handle is when the prediction is wrong and
  tredning begins in the other direction.
* Currently, I stay out unless the trending returns to the original direction,
  OR until ML predicts in the losing direction. I wonder, however, if there's a
  way to enter the opposite direction before the prediction correctly predicts
  it.

###### Notes
* Last night I ran all-scope predictions in backtesting and it far outperformed
  single-scope predictions, so I decided to try it in staging and production.
* Though it was profitable, it wasn't making predictions as intuitively as the
  single-scope predictions. For instance, AMZN held a long position for
  05:48:46, despite there being numerous indicators of bear trends.
* Maybe this is because the test set (each individual instrument's recent
  candles) is a different distribution than the training set?

###### Next Thing(s) to Try
* In either case, I'd like to see two things:
  1. What happens when I shuffle the training data, grouped by the input width
     of the model?
  2. What happens if add a GRU and SimpleRNN in the mix of predictions?

###### Notes
* I tried the machine learning strategy in production for the first time and
  reset the win record.
* It went well! Based on Paper Alpha's results over the past week, I decided to
  leave the wins open-ended. It ended up backfiring today, but we'll see how it
  goes in the near future.
* In the last week Paper Alpha's average daily return was +4.55%. That's
  really, really, good! It's better than if I secured +3.00% or even +5%. This
  is, however, by leaving losses open ended. We'll have to see how this affects
  returns in the next couple of weeks.

###### Notes
* I ran a backtest this weekend on 3 minute predictions. On a daily basis, it
  performed about the same as 5 minute predictions.
* Over the long run, it was unprofitable.
* The goal is still to have long term profit or guaranteed daily profit. Until
  I get that, this is no better than the finely tuned momentum algorithm.
* Meanwhile, Paper Alpha continues to do very well. Since introducing five
  minute predictions, it has always reached at least +2.00% in daily profit.
* Today and this past Friday have been the first two days where the ML
  algorithm has been able to run uninterrupted all day.
  * On Friday there was a 10-15 min interruption while as a I began a
    re-factor. Beyond that, the day ran smoothly.
* I'm waiting for a sequence of days in Paper Alpha whose max profit is <
  +2.00% and/or a backtest run that guarantees daily profit, before promoting
  the ML strategy to production.
* The 10-min prediction backtest performed better than the 3-min backtest, and
  just about the same as the 5-minute. That is, most days exceeded a +1-3%
  profit, but no specific profit was guaranteed.
* **ML-10 No Gain Days**

* Better Performer: Live Alpha: 2 • Paper Beta: 1 (Total: 3)

###### Notes
* ML is going well in that every day is maxxing out above +2%, but it's failing
  in that it ultimately loses at the end of each day.
* I would feel way more confident if this strategy made money every day, or if
  it were at least evident that it would make money over time.
* Backtesting ML using only LSTM was going well. It made at least +3% on 57% of
  days. At the end of the month it hit two big losses.

###### Notes
* Really good news! Overnight backtesting did REALLY well while testing the machine
  learning strategy 🎉🎈🎊
* Most days reached +3% profit and after just under a month, the return was 33.33%
* Today revealed some interesting issues:
  1. Alpaca spazzed out and disabled shorting of all stocks. This kept me out
     of trading for almost an hour during which I very likely could have hit
     another full win 😳.
     * This was out of my control and was resolved quickly.

  2. I discovered that the candle `opened_at`s and `closed_at`s have slowly
     been sliding forward in the future.
     * This was affecting when predictions were made and when they expired.
     * As a result, the predictions weren't very accurate.
     * I fixed the bug in the candle building code and rebuilt them.
     * Now I'll build a script to build all historical predictions for
       backtesting purposes.

###### Notes
* I introduced a bug into getting the freshest predictions with this weekend's
  refactors.
* I fixed it by 9am so after then is when you can start measuring the
  prediction algorithm's effectiveness.
* Paper Beta is now on a prolonged downturn. It's time to introduce its delayed
  first trade by 30 seconds.
* I may have fixed the backtest bug! I ran it against today's data and it
  yielded the results I've been anticipating.
* I'm going to run in further in the past and see how it performs.

###### Notes
* Today was the first day where machine learning controlled positions in Paper
  Alpha.
* It actually went as I was hoping -- a reasonable range of loss and profit
  that surpassed the goal of +1-2%.
* Backtest is demonstrating that the models fail abysmally, but I think there
  may be a bug.
* My goal this weekend is to tweak the ML strategy to see if I can guarantee a
  target profit of +1-2%

###### Notes
* The day I've been dreading finally came! Production reached the +6.35% target
  but failed to re-reach it after the expanding trailing stop triggered.
* This might only occur very infrequently, but it cost me a big win today.
* Futhermore there have only been a couple of days whose max balance exceeded
  the 0.5% trailing stop guaranteed profit level.
* The amount of extra earnings from those days doesn't exceed the amount that
  was lost today and that's after two months of trading with this strategy.
* I'm officially going to make the change that closes once the target profit
  has been reached, and no longer try to re-reach it.
* Though I may be foregoing some days of higher than targeted profit, it will
  be good to feel reassured when the target is finally reached.

* Today was a MAJOR milestone! I finally hit my $40K target!!! 🎉🎊🎈🎉
* This marks a 33.33% return after 1.5 months of the current strategy.
* It's time to scale up by transfering in more money from my savings.
* Paper Beta seems to be suffering, but I think it's because it's been filling
  orders almost as quickly as production. This misses out on the benefit of the
  25 second delay that I introduced.
* I'll keep watching Paper Beta to see if I need to introduce the delay there
  as well.
* For Machine Learning I've also:
  * Finished training
  * Introduced Python and its ML packages (numpy and tensorflow)
  * Written a script to generate five minute candles of all the quote data I've
    persisted to this point.
  * Started a program that trains a sequence model using these five minute
    candles.
* The next step is to finish training this model and use it to accurately
  predict the next five minutes of trading.
* The goal of this is to secure daily profit instead of ~45% of days.
* We still have a ways to go, but for now celebrate this HUGE win! You should
  be very proud of yourself 😎

###### Notes
* There was a hiccup today. The mysterious random restart happened during my
  late morning nap. I restarted when I awoke and luckily production won.
* I forgot to close the positions in Paper Alpha that remained open during the
  blackout, and the remained open overnight.
* This explains why Paper Alpha didn't trade tomorrow (I'm writing this on
  8/25).
* I'll manually close those still open positions in Paper Alpha

###### Notes
* Today was a big win for production over Paper Beta.
* It's also the highest account balance that production has _earned_. You
  should be really proud of this 🎉🎈🎊🥳
* Thought it's a bit premature, I should start to plan for scaling. This includes:
  * Discovering Alpaca's max order quantity, if any.
  * Observing performance with a higher balance in Paper Alpha
* It seems that Paper Alpha's performance is evident: This 2.5:1 strategy is
  mildy profitable over the long term, _if_ losses are unbounded or capped at
  -8%. The strategy, however, experiences periods of heavy loss which make it
  seem overal unprofitable in the short term.
* Paper Alpha's findings are also consistent with backtest results.

###### Next Thing(s) to Try
* Increase Paper Alpha's balance to $200K and observe what, if any, runtime
  issues I encounter.

###### Notes
* It seems safe to say that Paper Beta's strategy is profitable. It has reached
  its all time high and hasn't dipped below its principle.
* I'll continue trying to mimic its behavior in production and we'll see if the
  results are comparable.

###### Notes
* The clock desync still obscures backtesting's idempotence. Regardless, it
  doesn't seem that a 30-second delay start results in significantly improved
  performance. The 60x loss environment was the only one whose balance was
  higher compared to the backtest run on 6/30.
* I will therefore not add any delay to first orders placed and adjust the
  production stop loss to 60x.

###### Notes
* Wow. After a sample size of 70 days in which the win rate of the account
  profit successfully hitting +0.5%, I saw two consecutive loss days 😭
* As sad as it is, I think this definitively demonstrates that the slow climb
  strategy doesn't have a high enough win rate to guarantee long-term
  profitability.
* Next steps are as follows:
  1. Continue learning ML sequence modeling -- I think the main focus should now
     be shifted to building a way to predict price movement at greater than
     chance odds. I had an idea of clustering historical reversal points and
     use those as priedictors of price changes, however, I'm not confident in
     its efficacy. Besides, I suspect that a well-trained sequence model, which
     factors in historical information, will be just as good, if not better at
     predicting.

  2. In the mean time, try to replicate Paper Beta's success -- The paper
     environments have demonstrated one major finding: In order for the current
     algorithm to have any chance of success, you have to stop profits and
     losses at the goldn 2.5:1 ratio. That is, stop profits at +6.25% and
     losses at -2.5%. You'll remember, however, that when I last tried this in
     production, it seemed to fail miserably.

     Before trying again in production, I'll backtest a late start again, but
     this time it will approximately be the average delay of the first opening
     position in Paper Beta. Here are each accounts average Opened At seconds.
     You can see the query at tmp/positions_opened_at.sql:

     ```
     live-alpha: 6.0024014071428571s

     paper-alpha: 26.0721380774647887s

     paper-beta: 26.3954310754716981s
     ```

     In Paper beta, the longest loss streak with this strategy was seven days.
     The starting balance that can tolerate seven consecutive days of -2.5%
     loss and arrive at a $25K balance, is ~$30K.
